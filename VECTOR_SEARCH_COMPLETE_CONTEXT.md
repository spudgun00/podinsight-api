# Complete Context: 768D Vector Search Implementation

**Purpose**: Full context dump for next session to quickly understand the current state

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

A semantic search system using 768D embeddings (Instructor-XL model) to search podcast transcripts with high accuracy.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Query → Vercel API → Modal.com (Instructor-XL) → 768D Embedding
                ↓
        MongoDB Vector Search → Expanded Context → Results
```

---

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Modal Embedding Service
- URL: `https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run`
- Model: Instructor-XL (768D)
- Status: ✅ Deployed and working
- Test: `curl https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/health`

### 2. MongoDB Setup
- Database: `podinsight`
- Collection: `transcript_chunks_768d` (823,763 documents)
- Index: `vector_index_768d` (Atlas Vector Search)
- Status: ✅ Indexed and searchable

### 3. Search API
- File: `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`
- Import: `from .embeddings_768d_modal import get_embedder`
- Context expansion: ±20 seconds window
- Status: ✅ Finding relevant results with good context

### 4. Fixed Issues
- ✅ Async/sync conflict in Modal client
- ✅ Removed Supabase caching (was causing errors)
- ✅ Context expansion (was showing single sentences, now paragraphs)
- ✅ Deleted redundant `transcripts` collection

## ❌ The One Big Problem: Episode Metadata

### The Issue
```
S3 GUID:        1216c2e7-42b8-42ca-92d7-bad784f80af2
Supabase ID:    3a50ef5b-6965-4ae5-a062-2841f83ca24b
Match:          ❌ Completely different ID systems
```

### Impact
- Search works perfectly
- But shows "Unknown Episode" for all results
- Can't display episode titles or dates

### Why It Happened
1. June 19: Migrated episodes from Supabase → MongoDB with Supabase IDs
2. June 21: Re-processed from S3 files which use different GUIDs
3. No mapping between the two ID systems

---

## 📊 Current Data Reality

### What's in MongoDB:
```javascript
// transcript_chunks_768d collection
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  episode_id: "1216c2e7-42b8-42ca-92d7-bad784f80af2",  // S3 GUID
  feed_slug: "a16z-podcast",                            // Podcast identifier
  chunk_index: 0,
  text: "People use the term AI and they're like...",   // Transcript chunk
  embedding_768d: [0.024, 0.003, ...],                  // 768 floats
  start_time: 1.069,
  end_time: 3.831,
  speaker: null,
  created_at: ISODate("2025-06-21T17:03:08.866Z")
}
```

### What We Need:
- Episode titles
- Published dates
- Guest names
- Episode descriptions

---

## 🔧 Code Status

### Working Code:
```python
# api/search_lightweight_768d.py - Main search handler
async def search_handler_lightweight_768d(request: SearchRequest):
    # 1. Generate embedding via Modal
    embedding_768d = await generate_embedding_768d_local(request.query)
    
    # 2. Vector search in MongoDB
    vector_results = await vector_handler.vector_search(embedding_768d)
    
    # 3. Expand context (±20 seconds)
    for result in results:
        expanded_text = await expand_chunk_context(result)
    
    # 4. Return results (but without episode titles 😢)
```

### Test Results:
- "confidence with humility" → 142 words of context ✅
- "AI automation" → 99 words about AI solving challenges ✅
- Score: 0.96+ (excellent semantic matching) ✅
- Episode title: "Unknown Episode" ❌

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Session

### 1. Set Up Environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
export MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-uri"
```

### 2. Test Current State
```bash
# Test search functionality
python test_vector_focused.py

# See the metadata problem
python check_segment_data.py
```

### 3. Key Files to Review
- `api/search_lightweight_768d.py` - Has TODO comments for MongoDB caching
- `SPRINT_3_VECTOR_SEARCH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Today's work summary
- `chatgpt_episodeidmismatch.md` - Detailed analysis of ID problem

---

## 💡 Three Ways Forward

### Quick Fix (Hours)
```python
# Use feed_slug + date to guess episode
episode = supabase.table('episodes').select('*').eq(
    'feed_slug', chunk['feed_slug']
).gte('published_at', chunk_date - 1_day).lte(
    'published_at', chunk_date + 1_day
).execute()
```

### Proper Fix (1-2 days)
Build a mapping between S3 GUIDs and Supabase IDs by matching:
- Same podcast (feed_slug)
- Similar duration
- Close dates
- Maybe sample text matching

### Clean Slate (Best long-term)
Re-process everything with proper ID lookup, implementing larger chunk windows at the same time.

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Always preserve source IDs** when doing ETL
2. **Context window expansion** dramatically improves UX
3. **Modal.com** is perfect for large model hosting
4. **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** works great with high-dimensional vectors
5. **Data lineage matters** - losing the connection between systems is painful

---

## 📞 Who to Contact

- Modal.com dashboard: Check usage and logs
- MongoDB Atlas: Check index status
- Original ETL repo: Has the S3 → MongoDB pipeline code
