# Sprint 1 Progress Update - June 19, 2025 11:50 PM EST

## What We Just Accomplished

### ‚úÖ MongoDB Migration Verification Complete
- Confirmed 5 test episodes successfully migrated to MongoDB
- Each episode contains full transcript data (avg 61,818 characters)
- Text search indexes created and functioning
- Test suite passed with 100% success rate (6/6 tests)

### üìä Current MongoDB Status
```
Collection: transcripts
Documents: 5
Indexes: _id_, full_text_text, episode_id_1, published_at_1
Size: ~1.5 MB
Podcasts: This Week in Startups (1), a16z Podcast (3), Acquired (1)
```

### üîß Technical Issues Resolved
1. Fixed environment variable loading in Python scripts (added explicit path loading)
2. Verified MongoDB connection and authentication working
3. Confirmed S3 transcript discovery and download functioning
4. Validated data integrity - real conversation content stored

## Next Decision Point

**Option A: Run Full Migration (Recommended)**
- Execute: `python migrate_transcripts_to_mongodb.py`
- Time: ~39 minutes for all 1,171 episodes
- Result: Complete dataset ready for production search

**Option B: Continue with Test Data**
- Build Phase 3 search API with 5 episodes
- Test functionality before full migration
- Risk: Limited testing coverage

## Updated Todo Status
- ‚úÖ Verify MongoDB migration success
- ‚úÖ Run test_migration.py validation
- üîÑ Run full migration for 1,171 episodes (pending decision)
- ‚è≥ Create api/mongodb_search.py
- ‚è≥ Update api/search_lightweight.py
- ‚è≥ Test real search with >70% relevance
- ‚è≥ Deploy to Vercel with MONGODB_URI

## Key Learning
The test migration worked perfectly but was intentionally limited to 5 episodes. The "suspiciously fast" completion time was accurate for the small test batch. All technical challenges have been resolved and we're ready for full production migration.
