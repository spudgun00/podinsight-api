### Missing Episodes Investigation

The 171 "missing" episodes reveal an important pattern:

#### What's Missing
All 171 episodes share these characteristics:
- **No feed_slug** in database (field is null/empty)
- **No episode titles**
- **No S3 transcript paths** set
- **Different GUIDs than their episode IDs**

#### But They DO Have Audio Files!
Interestingly, these episodes DO have audio files in S3:
- Audio paths follow pattern: `s3://pod-insights-raw/the-pomp-podcast/[guid]/audio/episode.mp3`
- All appear to be from "The Pomp Podcast" based on S3 paths
- Date range: January 2025 - June 2025 (recent episodes)

#### Root Cause Analysis
These appear to be episodes where:
1. **Audio was successfully ingested** to S3
2. **Initial database record created** with basic info
3. **Transcription/enrichment pipeline failed** or hasn't run yet
4. **No feed_slug was populated** during ingestion

#### Distribution by Month
- January 2025: 31 episodes
- February 2025: 28 episodes
- March 2025: 35 episodes
- April 2025: 33 episodes
- May 2025: 36 episodes
- June 2025: 8 episodes

**Conclusion**: These are real Pomp Podcast episodes that were only partially processed. The AWS ingestion captured the audio but the transcription/enrichment pipeline didn't complete. They can be reprocessed in the future but don't affect current search functionality.

## What Was Migrated

1. **Full Transcripts** - Complete conversation text for search
2. **Time-coded Segments** - With start/end timestamps for audio playback
3. **Episode Metadata** - Title, podcast name, published date
4. **Topics** - When available (71.4% of episodes)

## Next Steps

With 1,000 episodes successfully migrated, we're ready to:
1. Create MongoDB search handler (`api/mongodb_search.py`)
2. Update search API to use real transcripts
3. Test search quality (target >70% relevance scores)
4. Deploy to production

The migration is complete and successful! 🎉
