# 🧹 Repository Cleanup Ready

## Quick Start
```bash
# Execute the cleanup (nothing is deleted, only archived)
./cleanup_repository.sh

# Review what was archived
cat archive/ARCHIVE_INDEX.md

# Find specific files later
find archive/ -name "*filename*"
```

## What Happens
1. ✅ **Nothing deleted** - all files moved to organized archives
2. 📦 **149 scripts archived** → `archive/2025-06-development/scripts/`
3. 📄 **17 docs archived** → `archive/development-notes/`
4. 🌐 **4 test files archived** → `archive/testing-archive/`
5. 🎯 **Clean repo** with only production essentials

## Files Kept (Production Ready)
- **Scripts**: 3 essential (Modal endpoint, E2E tests, VC validation)
- **Docs**: Architecture encyclopedia, cleanup strategy, README
- **Tests**: Primary advanced test interface

## Safe to Run
- Fully reversible (copy/move files back anytime)
- Complete archive index created
- Organized by date for future cleanups

**Ready when you are!** 🚀
