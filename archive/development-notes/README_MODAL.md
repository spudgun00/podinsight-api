# Modal.com Integration for 768D Embeddings

**Created**: June 21, 2025
**Status**: Successfully Deployed ✅
**Context**: Solving Vercel's 250MB deployment limit for Instructor-XL model (2GB+)

---

## 🎯 Summary

We've successfully deployed a 768D embedding service using Modal.com to overcome Vercel's deployment size limitations. The Instructor-XL model now runs on Modal's GPU infrastructure while your API remains on Vercel.

**Key Achievement**: Your vector search now works in production with full 768D embeddings!

## 🔗 Live Endpoints

### Modal Web Endpoint (LIVE)
```
https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run
```

### Available Routes:
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /embed` - Single text embedding
- `POST /embed_batch` - Batch embeddings

### Example Request:
```bash
curl -X POST https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/embed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "AI venture capital trends"}'
```

## 💰 Credits & Costs

- **Available Credits**: $5,030
- **Current Usage**: $0
- **Estimated Monthly**: ~$50-100 (depending on usage)
- **Credits Duration**: 50-100 months!

## 📁 Files Created

### Modal Deployments:
1. **`modal_web_endpoint.py`** ✅ - The working FastAPI deployment
2. **`modal_instructor_xl.py`** - Initial attempt (can be deleted)
3. **`modal_implementation.py`** - Old syntax (can be deleted)
4. **`get_started.py`** - Test file (can be deleted)

### API Integration:
1. **`api/embeddings_768d_modal.py`** - Modal HTTP client
2. **`api/search_lightweight_768d.py`** - Updated search with 768D support
3. **`api/mongodb_vector_search.py`** - MongoDB vector search implementation

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Request → Vercel API → Modal GPU (Instructor-XL) → 768D Embedding
                    ↓
            MongoDB Vector Search → Results
```

---

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Modal Deployment**: Function deployed with GPU acceleration
2. **MongoDB Integration**: 823,763 chunks with 768D embeddings indexed
3. **Vector Search Index**: Created in MongoDB Atlas
4. **Fallback Chain**: Vector → Text → 384D pgvector

---

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Update Search Import (CRITICAL)
In `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`, change line 20:
```python
# FROM:
from .embeddings_768d_modal_sdk import get_embedder
# TO:
from .embeddings_768d_modal import get_embedder
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Test in Browser
Use: `file:///Users/jamesgill/PodInsights/podinsight-api/test-search-browser-enhanced.html`

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Modal Deployment**: The app "podinsight-embeddings-api" is LIVE
2. **No Auth Required**: Endpoint is public (consider adding auth later)
3. **Cold Starts**: First request takes ~30s (model loading), then fast
4. **MongoDB Cluster**: Currently on M20 ($189/month) due to 2.38GB index

---

## 📊 Current Search Performance

- **Text Search**: Working, returns keyword matches
- **Vector Search**: Ready but needs final import update
- **Expected Results**: Semantic understanding of queries like "confidence with humility"

---

## 🔍 Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check Modal deployment
modal app list

# Test embedding endpoint
curl https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/health

# Monitor Modal dashboard
https://modal.com/apps/podinsighthq/main/deployed/podinsight-embeddings-api
```

---

## 💡 Cost Optimization

After vector search is confirmed working:
1. Email MongoDB about credits situation
2. Consider scaling to M10 if they don't provide more credits
3. Monitor Modal usage in dashboard

---

## ⚠️ Final Task

**The search is currently using text search, not vector search!**

To enable vector search:
1. Update the import as shown above
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Test with semantic queries

Once this final change is made, your 768D vector search will be fully operational!
