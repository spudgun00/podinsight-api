# E2E Test Results - Latest Status

## Quick Summary

The API is **PARTIALLY WORKING** with some improvements since earlier today:

| Query | Status | Method | Response Time |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|
| openai | ✅ Working | text | 7.6s |
| venture capital | ❌ Failing | - | 3.9s (503) |
| podcast | ✅ Working | text | 7.5s |
| startup | ❌ Failing | - | 10.0s (503) |

## Key Findings

1. **Text search is functional** - Queries like "openai" and "podcast" return results via text search
2. **Vector search is completely broken** - No queries are returning vector search results
3. **"podcast" is now working** - This was failing earlier, suggesting text search improvements
4. **Response times vary** - Successful queries take 7-8s, failures range from 4-10s

## Diagnostic Status

- **/__diag endpoint deployed** but returns 404 on production
- Cannot verify environment variables without diagnostic access
- Need to check Vercel deployment settings

## Root Cause Analysis

The advisor's diagnosis is correct - this is an environment/configuration issue:

1. **Vector search never works** - Suggests either:
   - Wrong MONGODB_DATABASE env var
   - Vector index not accessible
   - Modal embedding service URL incorrect

2. **Text search works intermittently** - Indicates:
   - MongoDB connection is partially working
   - Database exists but possibly wrong one
   - Text index is functional

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Access diagnostic endpoint** - Check why /__diag returns 404
2. **Verify Vercel env vars**:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI
   MONGODB_DATABASE (should be "podinsight")
   MODAL_EMBEDDING_URL
   ```
3. **Check MongoDB Atlas** - Ensure vector_index_768d is active
4. **Test locally with production MongoDB** - Isolate if issue is Vercel-specific

## Test Script Confirmation

Direct MongoDB test still shows vector search works perfectly:
- Modal → Atlas: ✅ 5 results for "venture capital"
- Atlas Text: ✅ 3 results
- API: ❌ 503 error

This proves the code is correct but the API is querying the wrong database/index.
