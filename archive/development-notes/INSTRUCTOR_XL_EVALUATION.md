instruction = "Represent the Business podcast transcript for retrieval:"

# For user queries
instruction = "Represent the Investment query for finding relevant discussions:"

# For topic classification
instruction = "Represent the Startup content for topic categorization:"

# For entity extraction
instruction = "Represent the Financial document for entity recognition:"
```

### **Single Model, Multiple Tasks**
- ✅ Semantic search
- ✅ Content classification
- ✅ Clustering/topic detection
- ✅ Entity relationship mapping
- ✅ Sentiment analysis preparation

## 12. Technical Implementation Strategy (IT Leadership)

### **Memory Requirements Mitigation**

The "high memory requirements" concern is **backend infrastructure only** and completely **transparent to users**:

#### **Infrastructure Solutions**
```
Option 1: Modal.com Serverless (Recommended)
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Pay only for actual usage
- No infrastructure management required
- Covered by existing $5,000 credits

Option 2: MongoDB Atlas + Modal Hybrid

- Modal handles embedding generation
- Distributed load, optimized costs

Option 3: Reserved GPU Instances
- Dedicated infrastructure for consistent performance
- Cost-effective for high usage
- Full control over resources
```

#### **Usage Optimization**
- **Batch processing:** Re-embed during low-traffic hours
- **Caching:** Store embeddings, not real-time generation
- **Smart routing:** Use cached embeddings when possible

### **Scope of Instructor-XL Usage**

#### **Primary Use: Semantic Search Embeddings**
```
✅ Episode content embedding for search
✅ User query embedding for matching
✅ Related content discovery
✅ Semantic similarity analysis
```

#### **Enhanced Capabilities**
```
✅ Entity relationship understanding
✅ Topic boundary detection
✅ Context-aware content classification
✅ Business domain specialization
```

#### **NOT Used For**
```
❌ Transcription (continues using Whisper/existing)
❌ Basic entity extraction (continues using spaCy/existing)
❌ Simple text search (continues using MongoDB text)
❌ Structured data queries (continues using Supabase)
```

### **Integration Architecture**
```
User Query → Instructor-XL embedding → Vector search → Business context ranking → Results
            ↓
Traditional text search (fallback) → MongoDB → Combined results
```
