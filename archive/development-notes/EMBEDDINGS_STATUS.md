# Embeddings Status Report

## Critical Discovery ✅ RESOLVED

The embeddings in S3 are **NOT** OpenAI 1536D embeddings as expected. They are:

- **384 dimensions** from **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2** (CONFIRMED)
- **Segment-level embeddings** (multiple per episode, e.g., 182-477 segments)
- **Stored as 2D arrays** in .npy files (shape: [num_segments, 384])

### Model Identification ✅ COMPLETE
**Confirmed Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
**Evidence Found:**
- `transcribe.py:37` - Default model configuration
- `backfill.py:192` - Same model used in backfill processing
- `rebuild_meta.py:242` - Consistent across all processing scripts

## Test Results

### 1. S3 Structure Analysis
```
Episode: 1216c2e7-42b8-42ca-92d7-bad784f80af2
- Shape: (182, 384) - 182 segments
- Dtype: float16
- Size: 136.6 KB

Episode: 24fed311-54ac-4dab-805a-ea90cd455b3b
- Shape: (477, 384) - 477 segments
- Dtype: float16
- Size: 357.9 KB

Episode: 46dc5446-2e3b-46d6-b4af-24e7c0e8beff
- Shape: (385, 384) - 385 segments
- Dtype: float16
- Size: 288.9 KB
```

### 2. Solution Implemented

Created `embeddings_loader_384d.py` that:
- Downloads segment embeddings from S3
- Averages all segments to get one 384D vector per episode
- Normalizes the averaged vector to unit length
- Handles parallel downloads (10 workers)
- Includes dry-run mode for testing

### 3. Production Results ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Migration applied successfully (384D vector schema)
- ✅ All 1,171 episodes loaded with embeddings
- ✅ 818,814 total segments processed and averaged
- ✅ ~600 MB total data downloaded
- ✅ Processing speed: ~15.5 episodes/second
- ✅ 100% success rate

### 4. Similarity Analysis Results
- ✅ High baseline similarity discovered (90-97% between episodes)
- ✅ Threshold-based search ineffective with current embeddings
- ✅ Ranked search approach implemented (`similarity_search_ranked`)
- ✅ Search infrastructure operational with relative ranking

## ✅ Actions Completed

### 1. Database Schema ✅ COMPLETE
```sql
-- Applied 002_vector_search_384d.up.sql successfully
-- Added vector(384) column, indexes, functions, and tables
```

### 2. Embeddings Loading ✅ COMPLETE
```bash
# Completed full production load
# All 1,171 episodes now have 384D embeddings
```

### 3. Search Implementation ✅ READY
- Model confirmed: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Use ranked search instead of threshold-based
- Infrastructure ready for API implementation

## Implications for Search

1. **Model Compatibility**: Need to use the same 384D model for query encoding
2. **Quality**: 384D embeddings can still provide good semantic search
3. **Performance**: Smaller vectors = faster similarity search
4. **Storage**: ~50% less storage than 1536D vectors

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE - Ready for Search API

### Completed:
1. ✅ Applied `002_vector_search_384d.up.sql` migration
2. ✅ Loaded all 1,171 episodes with embeddings
3. ✅ Confirmed model: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
4. ✅ Implemented ranked search approach

### Next Steps for Search API Implementation:
```python
# Use this exact model for query encoding
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Always use ranked search (not threshold-based)
results = similarity_search_ranked(query_embedding, limit=10)
```

### Technical Debt & Future Improvements:
1. **Search Quality:** Consider segment-level search vs averaging
2. **Model Alternatives:** Test OpenAI ada-002 or larger sentence-transformers
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Combine semantic + keyword search
4. **Performance:** Monitor and optimize similarity_search_ranked at scale
