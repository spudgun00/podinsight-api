# ChatGPT Advisor Prompt for PodInsight Vector Search Troubleshooting

## Context
I need help troubleshooting a vector search issue in our podcast search system. We use 768-dimensional embeddings from the Instructor-XL model to enable semantic search across 823,763 transcript chunks stored in MongoDB Atlas.

## Current Situation
- **What Works**: Some queries like "artificial intelligence" return results (3 results)
- **What Doesn't Work**: Many queries like "openai" and "venture capital" return 0 results
- **What We Did**: Removed the embedding instruction `"Represent the venture capital podcast discussion:"` from the Modal endpoint as a test
- **Result**: Partial improvement - some queries now work, but many still don't

## The Core Problem
We don't know how the original chunks were embedded when they were indexed. The chunks might have been embedded with:
1. No instruction at all
2. The instruction "Represent the venture capital podcast discussion:"
3. Some other instruction entirely
4. Different preprocessing (lowercase, tokenization, etc.)

When users search, the Modal endpoint generates embeddings for their queries. If these query embeddings don't match how the chunks were originally embedded, vector similarity scores will be too low to return results.

## Technical Details
- **Model**: hkunlp/instructor-xl (768 dimensions)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with vector search index `vector_index_768d`
- **Field**: Embeddings stored in `embedding_768d` field
- **Current Setup**: Modal endpoint with `INSTRUCTION = ""` (empty string)
- **Vector Search**: Using `$vectorSearch` with `numCandidates: 100` and `limit: 10`

## Evidence
1. Manual vector search in MongoDB works and returns results
2. The debug script shows chunks containing "openai" exist with valid embeddings
3. API searches for "openai" return 0 results
4. API searches for "artificial intelligence" return 3 results
5. Similarity threshold is set to 0.0 (no filtering)

## Questions I Need Help With

1. **How can I determine the original embedding instruction/method?**
   - Is there a way to reverse-engineer or test what instruction was used?
   - Should I try different instructions and compare embedding similarities?

2. **Why would some queries work and others not?**
   - "artificial intelligence" works (3 results)
   - "openai" doesn't work (0 results)
   - Both terms appear in the chunks

3. **What preprocessing differences could cause this?**
   - Case sensitivity?
   - Tokenization differences?
   - Special character handling?

4. **What's the best fix?**
   - Should we re-embed all 823,763 chunks with a consistent method?
   - Can we adjust the query embedding to match the original method?
   - Are there other approaches to consider?

## Available Resources
- Full access to MongoDB data
- Ability to modify the Modal embedding endpoint
- Python scripts for testing different embedding approaches
- 823,763 chunks already embedded (don't want to re-embed unless necessary)

## Constraints
- Production system with active users
- Re-embedding all chunks would be expensive and time-consuming
- Need to maintain backward compatibility if possible

Please help me:
1. Diagnose why embedding matching is failing for some queries
2. Determine the original embedding method
3. Recommend the best solution that minimizes disruption

I have provided complete system documentation and all code in the attached files. The critical file is `modal_web_endpoint_simple.py` which controls how query embeddings are generated.
