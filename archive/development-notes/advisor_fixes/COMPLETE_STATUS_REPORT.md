# Complete Status Report - PodInsight API Vector Search Issue

## Executive Summary

After implementing all of the advisor's debugging recommendations, we have partial visibility into the issue. Vector search is being attempted but consistently returns 0 results. The diagnostic endpoints are not accessible due to Vercel routing issues.

## Environment (Confirmed Facts)

- **MongoDB Cluster**: M20 (General) - AWS London
- **MongoDB Version**: 8.0.10
- **Documents**: 823,763 in transcript_chunks_768d
- **Vector Index**: vector_index_768d (READY status)
- **Local Tests**: Return 5 results for "venture capital" ✅
- **API Tests**: Return 0 results for same query ❌

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Diagnostic Endpoints (Partially Working)

**Created `api/diagnostic.py`**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient
import os, logging, traceback, time

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def diagnostic_root():
    # Tests MongoDB connection
    # Returns count, db name, env vars

@app.get("/vc")
async def diagnostic_vc():
    # Tests full pipeline: Modal embedding + MongoDB vector search
    # Returns hits count and results
```

**Status**: Returns 404 - Vercel not routing these endpoints properly

### 2. Enhanced Logging (Working)

Added to `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`:
```python
# ALWAYS log first result for debugging
if vector_results:
    first_result = vector_results[0]
    logger.info(f"[ALWAYS_LOG] First result score: {first_result.get('score', 'NO_SCORE')}")
    logger.info(f"[ALWAYS_LOG] First result keys: {list(first_result.keys())[:10]}")
else:
    logger.info(f"[ALWAYS_LOG] Vector search returned EMPTY results for '{clean_query}'")
```

Added to `api/mongodb_vector_search.py`:
```python
logger.info(f"[VECTOR_SEARCH] Attempt {attempt+1} returned {len(results)} results")
```

### 3. Removed 503 Gate (Working)

Now returns empty results instead of 503, allowing us to see logs.

## Vercel Logs Analysis

### From Latest Requests:

```
Jun 25 23:06:21.29 - POST /api/search - 200
INFO:api.search_lightweight_768d:[DEBUG] fallback_used: vector_768d

Jun 25 22:55:02.06 - POST /api/search - 200
WARNING:api.search_lightweight_768d:Returning empty results instead of 503 for debugging

Jun 25 22:47:07.64 - POST /api/search - 504
Vercel Runtime Timeout Error: Task timed out after 30 seconds
```

### Key Findings:

1. **Vector search IS being attempted** - `fallback_used: vector_768d`
2. **Returns 0 results** - Leading to empty response
3. **Some queries timeout** - 30-second Vercel limit hit
4. **Missing our new debug logs** - Need to check latest requests

### Diagnostic Endpoint Error (Fixed in code but not deployed):

```
GET /api/diagnostic - 500
TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class
```

Fixed by changing `handler = app` to `app = app`

## Current Test Results

### API Search Tests:
- `"venture capital"` → 0 results, search_method: "none_all_failed"
- `"openai"` → 3 results, search_method: "text" (not vector!)
- `"artificial intelligence"` → 3 results, search_method: "text"

**Critical**: Even successful queries are using text search, not vector search!

## What We Need From Vercel Logs

We need to see the latest logs with our new debugging, specifically:

1. **`[VECTOR_SEARCH]`** logs showing how many results MongoDB returns
2. **`[ALWAYS_LOG]`** logs confirming empty results
3. Any errors between "Calling vector search" and result logs
4. Why vector search fails for ALL queries (not just "venture capital")

## Root Cause Hypotheses

Based on current evidence:

1. **Network Issue**: Vercel lambda cannot reach MongoDB Atlas for vector operations
   - Regular queries work (text search)
   - Vector operations fail silently

2. **Index Access Issue**: Lambda has different permissions than local
   - Can read documents (text search works)
   - Cannot access vector index

3. **Embedding Issue**: Modal embeddings differ between local and production
   - Need to see embedding values in logs

4. **Pipeline Error**: Vector search aggregate pipeline fails
   - Need to see [VECTOR_SEARCH] logs

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Check Latest Vercel Logs** for:
   - `[VECTOR_SEARCH]` messages
   - `[ALWAYS_LOG]` messages
   - Any errors during vector search

2. **Get Diagnostic Endpoint Working**:
   - The `/api/diagnostic` endpoint would tell us immediately if it's network/connection
   - Currently returns 404 despite correct implementation

3. **If No New Logs Appear**:
   - Vector search handler might be returning null/undefined
   - Need to add logging at the very start of vector_search function

## Summary for Advisor

**The core mystery remains**:
- Same code, same database, same index
- Local: 5 results for "venture capital"
- Production: 0 results
- ALL queries fall back to text search (vector never works)

**We've added extensive logging but need to see the actual Vercel logs to diagnose further.**

The diagnostic endpoints (`/api/diagnostic` and `/api/diagnostic/vc`) are implemented but return 404, preventing us from running the isolated tests the advisor recommended.

**Next step**: Share the Vercel logs showing our new `[VECTOR_SEARCH]` and `[ALWAYS_LOG]` messages, or help us understand why the diagnostic endpoints return 404.
