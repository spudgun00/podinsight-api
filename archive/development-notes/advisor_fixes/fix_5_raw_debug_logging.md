# Fix 5: Add Raw Debug Logging âœ…

**Purpose:** Get detailed view of what vector search actually returns

**Changes made in `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`:**
- Added raw dump of first 3 vector search results
- Will show in Vercel logs when DEBUG_MODE=true

**What to look for:**
- Empty `score` fields
- Truncated `embedding_768d`
- Missing fields
- Unexpected data structure

**Status:** Ready to deploy
