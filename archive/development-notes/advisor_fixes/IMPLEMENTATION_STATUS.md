# Implementation Status Report - Vector Search Debug

## Current Situation

After implementing the advisor's fixes, we have the following status:

### 1. What We've Implemented

#### A. Modified `api/diag.py` ✅
- Removed the double-prefix issue by creating standalone FastAPI app
- Removed `app.include_router()` call
- Added direct route handlers (`@app.get`)

#### B. Updated `vercel.json` ✅
- Added specific rewrite rules for `/api/diag` routes
- Attempted to bypass the catch-all rewrite to `/api/index`

#### C. Previous Debug Logging (Already Deployed) ✅
In `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`:
```python
logger.info(f"[VECTOR_SEARCH_START] Called with limit={limit}, min_score={min_score}")
logger.info(f"[VECTOR_SEARCH] Attempt {attempt+1} returned {len(results)} results")
logger.info(f"[DEBUG] raw vector hits: {results[:3] if results else 'EMPTY'}")
logger.info(f"[ALWAYS_LOG] Vector search returned EMPTY results for '{clean_query}'")
```

### 2. Current Problems

#### Problem 1: Diagnostic endpoints still return 404
- `/api/diag` → 404
- `/api/diag/test` → 404
- `/api/diag/vc` → 404

**Root cause**: Vercel's routing system is not recognizing `api/diag.py` as a valid endpoint despite our rewrite rules.

#### Problem 2: No new debug logs appearing
Despite the enhanced logging being deployed, we're NOT seeing any of these logs:
- `[VECTOR_SEARCH_START]`
- `[VECTOR_SEARCH_ERROR]`
- `[ALWAYS_LOG]`
- `raw vector hits`

**This means**: The vector_search function is either:
1. Not being called at all
2. Failing before the first log statement
3. The logs are being suppressed somehow

### 3. Evidence from Logs

```
Jun 25 23:53:44.87 - INFO:api.search_lightweight_768d:[DEBUG] fallback_used: vector_768d
Jun 25 23:53:45.94 - WARNING:api.search_lightweight_768d:Returning empty results instead of 503 for debugging
```

This pattern shows:
1. Vector search IS selected as the fallback method
2. But returns empty results
3. No error logs between selection and empty result

### 4. MongoDB Connection Issue
```
Jun 25 23:35:41.20 - INFO:pymongo.serverSelection: topology_type: ReplicaSetNoPrimary
```
This indicates potential MongoDB connectivity issues from Vercel.

## Next Steps for Advisor

### Option 1: Fix Diagnostic Endpoints (if needed)
The diagnostic endpoints would help, but they're blocked by Vercel routing. Options:
1. Move diagnostic routes into `api/index.py` (merge with main app)
2. Create `api/diag/index.py` directory structure
3. Skip diagnostics and focus on main issue

### Option 2: Add Earlier Logging
Since we're not seeing ANY of the new logs, add logging even earlier:

```python
# In search_lightweight_768d.py, right after selecting vector handler:
logger.info(f"[PRE_VECTOR_SEARCH] About to call vector_search with embedding length: {len(embedding_768d)}")
try:
    logger.info(f"[PRE_VECTOR_SEARCH] vector_handler exists: {vector_handler is not None}")
    logger.info(f"[PRE_VECTOR_SEARCH] vector_handler.db exists: {vector_handler.db is not None}")
    vector_results = await vector_handler.vector_search(...)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"[VECTOR_SEARCH_OUTER_ERROR] {str(e)}")
    logger.error(f"[VECTOR_SEARCH_OUTER_ERROR] {traceback.format_exc()}")
```

### Option 3: Check MongoDB Handler Initialization
The issue might be in `get_vector_search_handler()`. Add logging there:

```python
def get_vector_search_handler():
    logger.info("[HANDLER_INIT] Starting MongoDB handler initialization")
    try:
        handler = MongoDBVectorSearch()
        logger.info(f"[HANDLER_INIT] Handler created, db exists: {handler.db is not None}")
        return handler
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"[HANDLER_INIT_ERROR] {str(e)}")
        return None
```

## Critical Questions for Advisor

1. **Should we continue trying to fix the diagnostic endpoints, or focus on adding more logging to the main search handler?**

2. **The vector_search function appears to be failing silently. Where should we add the next round of logging to catch this?**

3. **The MongoDB "ReplicaSetNoPrimary" error suggests connection issues. Should we add connection retry logic or check Atlas network settings?**

## Files Modified So Far

1. `api/diag.py` - Converted to standalone FastAPI app
2. `vercel.json` - Added rewrite rules for diag endpoints
3. `api/search_lightweight_768d.py` - Previously added comprehensive logging (but logs not appearing)
4. `api/mongodb_vector_search.py` - Previously added debug logging (but logs not appearing)

## Deployment Status

- Last commit: `2e8217c` - "fix: Remove double-prefix in diagnostic routes"
- Deployment completed but diagnostic endpoints still 404
- Main search endpoint works but returns empty results
- No new debug logs appearing in Vercel logs
