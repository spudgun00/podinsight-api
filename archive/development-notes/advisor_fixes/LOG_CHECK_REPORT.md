# Log Check Report - After Implementation

## What We've Done

1. **Added BOOT log** in `search_lightweight_768d.py`:
   ```python
   logging.getLogger(__name__).warning(
       "[BOOT] commit=%s  python=%s",
       os.getenv("VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA", "local"),
       os.environ.get("PYTHON_VERSION", "unknown"))
   ```

2. **Added diagnostic routes** in `topic_velocity.py`:
   - `/api/diag` - Basic MongoDB connection test
   - `/api/diag/vc` - Full vector search test for "venture capital"
   - Note: These are returning 404 due to Vercel routing issues

3. **Added VECTOR_SEARCH_ENTER log** in `mongodb_vector_search.py`:
   ```python
   logger.warning("[VECTOR_SEARCH_ENTER] path=%s idx=%s  len=%d",
                  self.collection.full_name if self.collection else "None",
                  "vector_index_768d", len(embedding))
   ```

## What to Check in Logs

After running:
```bash
curl -s https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/search \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"query":"venture capital","limit":5}'
```

### Look for these log patterns:

1. **[BOOT]** - Should appear once per cold start
   - If present: We're running new code
   - If absent: Still running old cached Lambda

2. **[VECTOR_SEARCH_ENTER]** - Should appear when vector_search is called
   - If present: Function is being called
   - If absent: Function never reached (problem is before vector search)

3. **[VECTOR_SEARCH_START]** - Should appear right after ENTER
   - If present but no results: MongoDB query is failing
   - If absent: Early return or exception

4. **[DEBUG] raw vector hits** - Should show actual MongoDB results
   - If present with data: Results are being lost later
   - If present but empty: MongoDB returns no matches

## Current Status

- Diagnostic endpoints return 404 (Vercel routing issue)
- Main search returns empty results for "venture capital"
- Need to check Vercel logs to see which debug messages appear

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Check latest logs
vercel logs https://podinsight-api.vercel.app --output raw | grep -E "(BOOT|VECTOR_SEARCH_ENTER|VECTOR_SEARCH_START|raw vector hits)" | tail -50
```
