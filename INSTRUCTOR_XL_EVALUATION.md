instruction = "Represent the Business podcast transcript for retrieval:"

# For user queries  
instruction = "Represent the Investment query for finding relevant discussions:"

# For topic classification
instruction = "Represent the Startup content for topic categorization:"

# For entity extraction
instruction = "Represent the Financial document for entity recognition:"
```

### **Single Model, Multiple Tasks**

| **Commercial Use** | $0 | Explicitly permitted |
| **API Fees** | $0 | Self-hosted, no external calls |
| **Ongoing Costs** | $0 | One-time setup only |

### **Infrastructure Costs**
```
Re-embedding Job: ~$50-100 (one-time GPU batch job)
Storage Increase: 600MB → 1.6GB (~$0.50/month additional)
Hosting: Use existing Modal.com credits or AWS/GCP GPU instances
```

### **vs Commercial Alternatives**
- **OpenAI ada-002:** $0.10 per 1M tokens
- **OpenAI text-embedding-3-large:** $0.13 per 1M tokens  
- **Voyage AI:** $0.10 per 1M tokens (with free tier)
- **Instructor-XL:** $0 after initial setup

**For 818,814 segments re-embedding:** OpenAI would cost ~$100-200, Instructor-XL costs $0

## 4. Modal.com Connection

### **What is Modal.com?**
- **Cloud platform** for running AI models at scale
- **NOT the model owner** - they provide hosting infrastructure
- Offers GPU instances, auto-scaling, and serverless deployment

### **Modal Credits**
- **Standard:** $30/month free credits
- **Startup Program:** Up to $50k credits available
- **Academic/Research:** Additional credit programs
- **Note:** The "$5k credits" likely refers to startup/research program

### **Modal Integration**
```python
# Example Modal deployment for Instructor-XL
import modal

@app.function(gpu="A10G", memory=16384)
def embed_text(instruction: str, text: str):
    from InstructorEmbedding import INSTRUCTOR
    model = INSTRUCTOR('hkunlp/instructor-xl')
    return model.encode([[instruction, text]])
```

## 7. Implementation Requirements

### **Out-of-the-Box Usage**
**✅ NO fine-tuning required** - works immediately with instruction prompting

```python
# Installation
pip install InstructorEmbedding

# Basic usage
from InstructorEmbedding import INSTRUCTOR
model = INSTRUCTOR('hkunlp/instructor-xl')

# For podcast content
instruction = "Represent the Business podcast transcript for retrieval:"
text = "Sequoia Capital announced a $200M investment in OpenAI..."
embedding = model.encode([[instruction, text]])
```

### **Infrastructure Setup**

**Option 1: Modal.com (Recommended)**
```python
# Use existing credits, auto-scaling, managed infrastructure
@modal.App.function(gpu="A10G", memory=16384)
def generate_embeddings(texts, instructions):
    # Instructor-XL code here
    pass
```

**Option 2: AWS/GCP**
```
GPU Instance: g5.xlarge (A10G, 24GB VRAM)

```python
# If PoC successful
1. Re-embed all 1,171 episodes (use batch job)
2. Widen Supabase vector column: vector(384) → vector(768)
3. Keep 384D backup for 7 days
4. Update search API to use new embeddings
```

**Phase 3: Optimization (Week 4)**
```python
# Fine-tune instructions for podcast-specific use cases
