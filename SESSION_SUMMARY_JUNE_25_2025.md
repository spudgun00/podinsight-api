# Session Summary - June 25, 2025
## MongoDB Metadata Migration & API Update

### üéØ Session Objective
Fix broken vector search showing "Episode from June 24, 2025" placeholders with "NaN% relevant" scores by migrating episode metadata from Supabase to MongoDB.

### üìä Starting State
- **Problem**: Search returning placeholder episode titles despite vector search working perfectly
- **Root Cause**: Supabase contained only placeholder data; real metadata existed in S3 but wasn't synced
- **Impact**: Users seeing unhelpful "Episode XXX" instead of real titles like "Chris Dixon: Stablecoins, Startups, and the Crypto Stack"

### ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

#### 1. Diagnosed the Issue
- Confirmed vector search working (Modal.com integration functioning correctly)
- Discovered Supabase had 90% placeholder data
- Found real metadata in S3 files at `pod-insights-stage/{feed}/{guid}/meta/`

#### 2. MongoDB Migration (ETL Team)
- Created new MongoDB collection: `episode_metadata`
- Successfully imported 1,236 episodes from S3
- Preserved complete metadata structure including guests, segments, etc.

#### 3. API Update (This Session)
- Modified `api/mongodb_vector_search.py` to query MongoDB instead of Supabase
- Updated `_enrich_with_metadata()` method to handle nested data structure
- Added guest names and segment counts to search results
- Committed and pushed changes (commit e88153d)

### üìÇ Key Documents Created

1. **SUPABASE_EPISODE_METADATA_ISSUE_REPORT.md**
   - Complete analysis of the metadata problem
   - ETL instructions for MongoDB import
   - S3 bucket structure and file locations

2. **COMPLETE_SYSTEM_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md**
   - Current system state after fixes
   - Comprehensive testing plan (5 phases)
   - Performance expectations and success metrics

3. **MONGODB_METADATA_API_UPDATE.md**
   - Technical details of API changes
   - Verification instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide

### üîÑ Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MongoDB Import | ‚úÖ Complete | 1,236 episodes with full metadata |
| API Code Update | ‚úÖ Complete | Pushed to GitHub |
| Vercel Deployment | ‚è≥ Pending | Auto-deploy in progress (~5 min) |
| Testing | ‚è≥ Waiting | Needs deployment first |

### üöÄ Next Steps (In Order)

#### 1. Verify Deployment (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# Test if real titles are showing
curl -X POST https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Chris Dixon crypto", "limit": 3}'
```

Expected: Should see "Chris Dixon: Stablecoins, Startups, and the Crypto Stack" not "Episode XXX"

#### 2. Run Test Suites (After deployment verified)
```bash
python3 scripts/test_e2e_production.py
python3 scripts/test_data_quality.py
```

Target: 5/5 test categories passing

#### 3. Update Documentation
- DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md - Add MongoDB as primary metadata source
- Remove references to Supabase for episode metadata

#### 4. Monitor Production
- Check for any edge cases
- Verify performance remains <1s warm requests
- Ensure no regressions

### üîë Key Technical Details

**MongoDB Document Structure**:
```json
{
  "guid": "0e983347-7815-4b62-87a6-84d988a772b7",
  "raw_entry_original_feed": {
    "episode_title": "Chris Dixon: Stablecoins, Startups, and the Crypto Stack",
    "podcast_title": "a16z Podcast",
    "published_date_iso": "2025-06-09T10:00:00"
  },
  "guests": [
    {"name": "Chris Dixon", "role": "guest"}
  ],
  "segment_count": 411
}
```

**API Extraction Logic**:
```python
# Extract from nested structure
raw_feed = doc.get('raw_entry_original_feed', {})
episode_title = raw_feed.get('episode_title') or doc.get('episode_title')
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Dates are Correct**: 2025 dates are real (we're in June 2025)
2. **S3 Location**: Metadata is in STAGE bucket, not RAW
3. **No Supabase Changes**: Left Supabase untouched for safety
4. **Guest Data**: Successfully preserved in MongoDB

### üìû Handoff Notes

The system is functionally complete pending Vercel deployment. Once the API deploys (should be within 5-10 minutes of commit e88153d), the search will show real episode titles and guest information. 

All test scripts and documentation are in place for verification. The main task remaining is monitoring the deployment and running the test suites to confirm everything works end-to-end.

For any issues, check:
1. Vercel deployment logs
2. MongoDB connection from Vercel
3. The test commands in this document
