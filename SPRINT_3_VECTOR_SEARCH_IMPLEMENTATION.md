# Sprint 3: 768D Vector Search Implementation & Context Expansion

**Date**: June 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Vector search with episode metadata working!

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

1. ✅ Implement 768D vector search using Modal.com (Instructor-XL model)
2. ✅ Fix truncated text issue with context expansion
3. ✅ Resolve episode metadata mismatch
4. ✅ Test and validate search quality

---

## ✅ What's Been Accomplished

### 1. Modal.com Integration (COMPLETE)
- Successfully deployed Instructor-XL (2GB model) on Modal
- Endpoint: `https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run`
- Response time: ~0.3-0.5s per embedding
- $5,030 in credits available (50-100 months of usage)

### 2. MongoDB Vector Search (COMPLETE)
- Vector index `vector_index_768d` created and READY
- 823,763 chunks indexed with 768D embeddings
- High-quality semantic matches (0.96+ similarity scores)
- Search method properly using `vector_768d`

### 3. Context Expansion Fix (COMPLETE)
- Implemented ±20 second context window expansion
- Single sentences → readable paragraphs (100-150 words)
- Performance impact: negligible (<15ms)
- Code location: `api/search_lightweight_768d.py` - `expand_chunk_context()`

### 4. Code Cleanup (COMPLETE)
- Fixed async/sync issues in `embeddings_768d_modal.py`
- Removed Supabase caching dependencies (commented out)
- Deleted redundant `transcripts` collection (saved 787MB)

---

## ✅ RESOLVED: Episode ID Matching

### Great News! IDs Actually Match! 
**Discovered**: June 21, 2025 (Session 2)

**Key Finding**:
- MongoDB `episode_id` = Supabase `guid` field ✅
- They match 100%! No mismatch after all!
- Confusion was: Supabase has TWO ID fields:
  - `id`: Internal Supabase UUID (we don't need this)
  - `guid`: The actual episode GUID (matches MongoDB perfectly)

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `mongodb_vector_search.py` to fetch metadata from Supabase
- Changed from querying deleted `transcripts` collection to Supabase API
- Join on: `MongoDB.episode_id = Supabase.guid`

**Current Status**:
- Code updated but needs one small async fix
- Episode titles are generic ("Episode 003e4b4f") - ETL issue, not our problem
- But the connection works!

## ✅ All Issues Resolved!

### 1. ~~Async Aggregate Fix~~ ✅ FIXED
Added proper `await` to MongoDB operations

### 2. ~~Episode Metadata~~ ✅ FIXED  
Successfully fetching from Supabase using guid field

### 3. ~~Context Expansion~~ ✅ FIXED
Expanding from single words to 100-200 word paragraphs

## 🎉 Final Test Results

- **"AI and machine learning"** → 3 results (0.976 score)
- **"confidence with humility"** → 3 results (0.978 score)  
- **"startup founders"** → 3 results (0.987 score)

All with proper episode titles, podcast names, dates, and S3 paths!

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATION: Incomplete Coverage

### The Problem:
- **83% of transcript content is missing** from the search index
- Original transcripts: ~1,082 segments per episode
- Indexed chunks: Only ~182 chunks per episode
- 142 gaps between chunks in typical episodes

### Why Context Expansion Isn't Enough:
- Our ±20 second expansion helps bridge gaps between existing chunks
- But it can't recover the 83% of content that was never indexed
- Users might search for content that exists in the missing portions

### Root Cause:
The ETL process had aggressive filtering that removed:
- Silent portions
- Short segments
- Segments without clear speakers
- Other filtered content

### Recommended Solution:
**Re-run the ETL process** with less aggressive filtering to ensure complete coverage. The context expansion is a band-aid, not a cure for missing data.

## 📊 Testing Results

### Successful Tests:
1. **Modal endpoint**: Health check passing, embeddings returning 768D
2. **Context expansion**: ~30 chars → 500-900 chars successfully
3. **Vector search**: Finding semantically relevant results
4. **Performance**: <15ms overhead for context expansion

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test Modal endpoint directly
curl https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/health

# Run comprehensive tests
python test_768d_modal_comprehensive.py
python test_vector_focused.py
python test_context_expansion.py
```

## 🗂️ Current Data Structure

### MongoDB Collections:
1. **transcript_chunks_768d** (823,763 docs)
   - Has: text, embeddings, timestamps, speaker info
   - Episode IDs: S3 GUIDs
   - Created: June 21, 2025

2. **~~transcripts~~** (DELETED)
   - Was redundant with chunks
   - Had different episode IDs

### Key Fields in chunks:
```javascript
{
  episode_id: "1216c2e7-42b8-42ca-92d7-bad784f80af2",  // S3 GUID
  feed_slug: "a16z-podcast",
  text: "People use the term AI...",
  embedding_768d: [768 floats],
  start_time: 1.069,
  end_time: 3.831,
  chunk_index: 0
}
```

---

## 🔧 Proposed Solutions for Metadata

### Option A: Build GUID Mapping (1-2 days)
1. Extract S3 GUIDs from filenames
2. Match to Supabase episodes by feed_slug + date/duration
3. Create mapping table
4. Update chunks with correct episode_ids

### Option B: Fetch Metadata Differently (Quick fix)
1. Use feed_slug + timestamps to approximate episode
2. Query Supabase by podcast name + date range
3. Show best-guess episode title

### Option C: Re-process Everything (Clean solution)
1. Re-run ETL with proper ID lookup
2. Use larger chunk windows while at it
3. Cost: ~$4 Modal credits
4. Time: 1 day

## 📝 Code Locations

### Key Files:
- `api/search_lightweight_768d.py` - Main search handler with context expansion
- `api/embeddings_768d_modal.py` - Modal API client for embeddings
- `api/mongodb_vector_search.py` - MongoDB vector search implementation

### Important Functions:
- `expand_chunk_context()` - Expands text context ±20 seconds
- `search_handler_lightweight_768d()` - Main search endpoint
- `get_embedder()` - Returns Modal embedding client

---

## 🔄 Code Changes Made (Session 2)

### 1. Updated `mongodb_vector_search.py`
- Added Supabase client initialization in `__init__`
- Completely rewrote `_enrich_with_metadata()` method:
  - OLD: Queried MongoDB `transcripts` collection (deleted)
  - NEW: Queries Supabase `episodes` table using `guid` field
  - Returns: episode_title, podcast_name, published_at, s3_audio_path, duration_seconds

### 2. Updated `search_lightweight_768d.py`
- Removed duplicate Supabase query (lines 291-317)
- Metadata now comes directly from vector search results
- Cleaner, more efficient code

### 3. What Still Needs Fixing:
```python
# Line 110 in mongodb_vector_search.py needs:
cursor = self.collection.aggregate(pipeline)
results = await cursor.to_list(None)  # Add await!
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (for deployment):
1. ✅ ~~Fix the async issue~~ DONE
2. ✅ ~~Test the complete flow~~ DONE
3. **Fix text search fallback** (point to chunks collection)
4. **Deploy to Vercel**
5. **Update browser test file**

### Critical (for data completeness):
1. **RE-RUN ETL PROCESS** with less aggressive filtering
   - Current: Only 182 chunks per episode (17% coverage)
   - Target: 1,000+ chunks per episode (near 100% coverage)
   - Remove filters for silent portions, short segments, etc.
   
2. **Consider larger chunk windows**
   - Current: Very small chunks (often single sentences)
   - Better: 30-60 second chunks with overlap
   - This would reduce the need for context expansion

### Why This Matters:
Without re-running ETL, users might search for content that exists in episodes but was filtered out during chunk creation. The search works perfectly for what's indexed, but 83% of content is missing!
