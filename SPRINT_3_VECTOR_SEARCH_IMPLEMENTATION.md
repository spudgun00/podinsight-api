# Sprint 3: 768D Vector Search Implementation & Context Expansion

**Date**: June 21, 2025  
**Status**: Core functionality working, metadata issues need resolution

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

1. Implement 768D vector search using Modal.com (Instructor-XL model)
2. Fix truncated text issue with context expansion
3. Resolve episode metadata mismatch
4. Test and validate search quality

---

## ✅ What's Been Accomplished

### 1. Modal.com Integration (COMPLETE)
- Successfully deployed Instructor-XL (2GB model) on Modal
- Endpoint: `https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run`
- Response time: ~0.3-0.5s per embedding
- $5,030 in credits available (50-100 months of usage)

### 2. MongoDB Vector Search (COMPLETE)
- Vector index `vector_index_768d` created and READY
- 823,763 chunks indexed with 768D embeddings
- High-quality semantic matches (0.96+ similarity scores)
- Search method properly using `vector_768d`

### 3. Context Expansion Fix (COMPLETE)
- Implemented ±20 second context window expansion
- Single sentences → readable paragraphs (100-150 words)
- Performance impact: negligible (<15ms)
- Code location: `api/search_lightweight_768d.py` - `expand_chunk_context()`

### 4. Code Cleanup (COMPLETE)
- Fixed async/sync issues in `embeddings_768d_modal.py`
- Removed Supabase caching dependencies (commented out)
- Deleted redundant `transcripts` collection (saved 787MB)

---

## ❌ Outstanding Issues

### 1. Episode Metadata Mismatch (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Episode IDs don't match between S3 GUIDs and Supabase IDs

**Details**:
- S3 files use GUIDs like: `1216c2e7-42b8-42ca-92d7-bad784f80af2`
- Supabase uses different IDs: `3a50ef5b-6965-4ae5-a062-2841f83ca24b`
- No mapping exists between them
- Result: All episodes show as "Unknown Episode"

**Impact**: Users can't see episode titles or dates

### 2. Text Search Fallback
Some episode IDs aren't valid UUIDs, causing fallback to text search instead of vector search.

---

## 📊 Testing Results

### Successful Tests:
1. **Modal endpoint**: Health check passing, embeddings returning 768D
2. **Context expansion**: ~30 chars → 500-900 chars successfully
3. **Vector search**: Finding semantically relevant results
4. **Performance**: <15ms overhead for context expansion

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test Modal endpoint directly
curl https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/health

# Run comprehensive tests
python test_768d_modal_comprehensive.py
python test_vector_focused.py
python test_context_expansion.py
```

## 🗂️ Current Data Structure

### MongoDB Collections:
1. **transcript_chunks_768d** (823,763 docs)
   - Has: text, embeddings, timestamps, speaker info
   - Episode IDs: S3 GUIDs
   - Created: June 21, 2025

2. **~~transcripts~~** (DELETED)
   - Was redundant with chunks
   - Had different episode IDs

### Key Fields in chunks:
```javascript
{
  episode_id: "1216c2e7-42b8-42ca-92d7-bad784f80af2",  // S3 GUID
  feed_slug: "a16z-podcast",
  text: "People use the term AI...",
  embedding_768d: [768 floats],
  start_time: 1.069,
  end_time: 3.831,
  chunk_index: 0
}
```

## 🔧 Proposed Solutions for Metadata

### Option A: Build GUID Mapping (1-2 days)
1. Extract S3 GUIDs from filenames
2. Match to Supabase episodes by feed_slug + date/duration
3. Create mapping table
4. Update chunks with correct episode_ids

### Option B: Fetch Metadata Differently (Quick fix)
1. Use feed_slug + timestamps to approximate episode
2. Query Supabase by podcast name + date range
3. Show best-guess episode title

### Option C: Re-process Everything (Clean solution)
1. Re-run ETL with proper ID lookup
2. Use larger chunk windows while at it
3. Cost: ~$4 Modal credits
4. Time: 1 day

## 📝 Code Locations

### Key Files:
- `api/search_lightweight_768d.py` - Main search handler with context expansion
- `api/embeddings_768d_modal.py` - Modal API client for embeddings
- `api/mongodb_vector_search.py` - MongoDB vector search implementation

### Important Functions:
- `expand_chunk_context()` - Expands text context ±20 seconds
- `search_handler_lightweight_768d()` - Main search endpoint
- `get_embedder()` - Returns Modal embedding client

## 🚀 Next Steps for New Session

1. **Decide on metadata solution** (A, B, or C above)
2. **Implement chosen solution**
3. **Test full search flow with episode titles**
4. **Deploy to Vercel**
5. **Update browser test file**

---

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Vector search is working** - The core functionality is solid
2. **Context expansion solved UX issue** - No re-embedding needed
3. **Metadata is the only blocker** - Everything else is ready
4. **Modal integration successful** - No more local model loading

## 🔐 Environment Variables Needed

```bash
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
MODAL_EMBEDDING_URL=https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run
# Modal endpoint is public, no auth needed
```
