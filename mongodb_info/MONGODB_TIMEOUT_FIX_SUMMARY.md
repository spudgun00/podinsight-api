# MongoDB Timeout Fix Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated MongoDB Connection Timeouts (improved_hybrid_search.py)

**Changed from dynamic timeout calculation to pragmatic fixed timeouts:**

```python
# OLD: Dynamic timeout that resulted in ~10ms timeouts
dynamic_timeout = max(3000, min(8000, int(time_remaining * 1000 * 0.5)))

# NEW: Fixed timeouts optimized for serverless
connection_timeout = 10000  # 10 seconds for server selection
connect_timeout = 5000      # 5 seconds for initial socket connection
socket_timeout = 45000      # 45 seconds for long-running queries
```

**Rationale:**
- 10s handles 99% of MongoDB replica set failovers
- Leaves 20s for actual search operations within Vercel's 30s limit
- Fail-fast approach provides better error handling than hitting Vercel timeout

### 2. Enhanced Connection Pool Settings

```python
client = AsyncIOMotorClient(
    uri,
    serverSelectionTimeoutMS=connection_timeout,  # 10s (was dynamic ~10ms)
    connectTimeoutMS=connect_timeout,             # 5s for initial connection
    socketTimeoutMS=socket_timeout,               # 45s for long queries
    maxPoolSize=100,                              # Increased from 10
    minPoolSize=10,                               # Keep connections warm
    maxIdleTimeMS=60000,                          # Keep idle connections for 1 minute
    retryWrites=True,
    retryReads=True,                              # Added for read resilience
    readPreference='secondaryPreferred',
    w='majority'                                  # Added for write durability
)
```

### 3. Added Connection Timing Monitoring

```python
connection_start = time.time()
# ... create client ...
connection_time = time.time() - connection_start
if connection_time > 5:
    logger.warning(f"Slow MongoDB client creation: {connection_time:.2f}s")
```

### 4. Implemented Connection Warming

**New function in improved_hybrid_search.py:**
- `warm_mongodb_connection()` - Pre-establishes connections on startup
- Integrated into `/api/prewarm` endpoint alongside Modal warming
- Runs ping and find_one() to warm connection pool

### 5. Fixed Datetime Deprecation Warnings

```python
# OLD
datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"

# NEW
datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **Cold Start**: 2-5 seconds (one-time connection establishment)
2. **Warm Requests**: <1 second for vector search, <0.5 seconds for text search
3. **Total Search Time**: <2 seconds (well within Vercel's 30s limit)
4. **Error Handling**: Proper 503 errors instead of generic Vercel timeouts

## Deployment Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Call `/api/prewarm` endpoint after deployment to warm connections
3. Monitor logs for connection timing analytics
4. Verify search latency meets targets

## Monitoring

Look for these log messages:
- `"MongoDB client created in X.XXs"` - Should be <5s
- `"MongoDB connection warmed up successfully"` - Indicates warming worked
- `"Slow MongoDB client creation"` - Warning if connection takes >5s
- `MONGODB_ANALYTICS` entries - Detailed timing information

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the changes are isolated to:
1. `api/improved_hybrid_search.py` - Connection configuration
2. `api/routers/prewarm.py` - Warming endpoint

These can be reverted independently if needed.
