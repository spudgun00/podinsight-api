# Modal.com Integration - Complete Context for Next Session

## üö® CRITICAL: What Just Happened
The search was using TEXT SEARCH instead of VECTOR SEARCH. I just fixed this by:
1. Changed import in `api/search_lightweight_768d.py` line 20 from `embeddings_768d_modal_sdk` to `embeddings_768d_modal`
2. Removed auth checks in `api/embeddings_768d_modal.py` since endpoint is public

## üìç Current Status
- **Modal Deployment**: LIVE at https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-api-fastapi-app.modal.run
- **768D Embeddings**: Working via Modal GPU
- **MongoDB**: 823,763 documents with 768D embeddings indexed
- **Vector Search**: NOW ENABLED (was falling back to text search before)

## üéØ What This Solves
User had 5 test episodes to improve semantic search for VC/technical terms. Vercel's 250MB limit blocked the 2GB Instructor-XL model. User revealed $5,000 Modal credits, so we deployed to Modal with GPU.

## üìÅ Key Files
1. **modal_web_endpoint.py** - The working Modal deployment
2. **api/embeddings_768d_modal.py** - Modal HTTP client (just updated)
3. **api/search_lightweight_768d.py** - Search API (import just fixed)
4. **README_MODAL.md** - Original instructions

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- Modal endpoint returns 768D embeddings
- MongoDB vector index created
- Search API configured with fallback chain: Vector ‚Üí Text ‚Üí pgvector

## üî¥ Next Steps
1. **Deploy to Vercel**: `vercel --prod`
2. **Test**: Use test-search-browser-enhanced.html
3. **Verify**: Search for "confidence with humility" should return semantic matches

## üí° Context
- User lost credits before with "bad intel", wants careful approach
- Has $500 MongoDB credits (using M20 tier at $189/month)
- Wants practical solutions, follows official docs
- 5 test episodes: Harry Stebbings, Jason Calacanis, Tim Ferriss, Acquired, All-In

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Fix That Just Happened
The import was wrong - it was trying to import `embeddings_768d_modal_sdk` which doesn't exist. Changed to `embeddings_768d_modal` which is the actual file. This enables vector search instead of text fallback.

**STATUS: Ready to deploy and test!**
