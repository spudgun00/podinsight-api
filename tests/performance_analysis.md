# Performance Analysis - API Slowdown Investigation

## Key Findings

### 1. Direct Database Performance (Baseline)
- Simple count query: ~91ms
- Topic mentions query (12 weeks, 5 topics): ~70ms
- Without join: ~62ms
- Single topic: ~45ms
- Simple queries: ~32ms average

### 2. API Endpoint Performance
- Health endpoint: ~143ms average (but high variance: 41-504ms)
- Topic velocity (12 weeks): ~213ms
- Single topic: ~146ms
- Pool stats endpoint: ~0.5ms (minimal overhead)

### 3. Performance Breakdown
- Direct DB query for topic mentions: ~70ms
- API endpoint for same data: ~213ms
- **Overhead: ~143ms (203% slower)**

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Connection Pool Overhead**: Minimal (~0.5ms based on pool stats endpoint)

2. **Data Processing Overhead**: 
   - The API does significant post-processing:
     - Parsing dates with dateutil.parser
     - Building weekly aggregations
     - Creating Recharts-compatible data structure
     - Multiple additional queries (episodes count, date range)

3. **Multiple Sequential Queries**:
   - Main topic mentions query: ~70ms
   - Episodes count query: ~91ms
   - Date range queries (2x): ~32ms each
   - Total: ~225ms (matches observed ~213ms)

4. **Async Overhead**: 
   - The connection pool uses async/await but Supabase client is synchronous
   - This adds some overhead for context switching

## Conclusions

The performance regression from ~50ms to ~200-280ms is due to:

1. **Additional queries**: Sprint 0 might have been measuring a simpler endpoint
2. **Data volume**: More data accumulated since Sprint 0
3. **Processing complexity**: Building the weekly aggregation data structure
4. **Multiple database roundtrips**: 4 separate queries instead of optimized single query

## Recommendations

1. **Short term**: Accept current performance as it's still under 300ms
2. **Optimization opportunities**:
   - Combine queries into single database call
   - Cache episode count and date range (rarely changes)
   - Pre-aggregate weekly data in database
   - Use database views for common aggregations

The current performance is acceptable for Sprint 1, but should be optimized if it becomes a bottleneck.
