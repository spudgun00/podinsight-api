- Podcast names correctly assigned
- S3 stage prefixes available for transcript access
- Published dates and duration data present

### Topic Mentions
- 3/5 episodes have topic associations
- Topic mentions table properly linked via episode_id
- Diverse topic coverage across episodes

### Data Consistency
- No duplicate episode IDs found
- Clean GUID format (UUID4)
- Proper foreign key relationships

## Pending MongoDB Tests

Once ETL migration completes, verify:

1. **Episode Coverage**
   ```python
   # Check if all 5 test episodes exist in transcript_chunks_768d
   TEST_EPISODES = [
       "1b50f025-61ca-4f14-b539-dc1b384944e9",
       "d05af383-6a21-4d12-8ebf-cf586bae2439", 
       "3a50ef5b-6965-4ae5-a062-2841f83ca24b",
       "30d79807-5785-4fc9-9c81-6351b9487931",
       "48ecc221-27e6-4c40-9b4e-e8e3dd670474"
   ]
   ```

2. **Chunk Structure**
   - Verify each episode has multiple chunks
   - Check embedding_768d field exists and populated
   - Confirm feed_slug alignment with Supabase podcast_name

3. **Vector Search Index**
   - Verify vector search index on embedding_768d field
   - Test sample vector search queries
   - Confirm search returns relevant results

4. **Data Alignment**
   - Compare episode metadata between systems
   - Verify topic information consistency
   - Check transcript chunk count vs episode duration

## Ready for Alignment Testing

### Test Scripts Ready
- `test_5_podcast_alignment.py` - Full alignment verification
- `get_real_test_episodes.py` - Episode discovery utility
- `test_supabase_only.py` - Supabase verification (completed)

### Connection Details Verified
- MongoDB URI format correct
- User permissions: atlasAdmin@admin (All Resources)
- Authentication method: SCRAM
- Password confirmed working in ETL repo

## Next Actions

1. **Wait** for ETL migration to complete
2. **Test MongoDB connection** with alignment script
3. **Verify** all 5 episodes migrated successfully
4. **Run** comprehensive alignment tests
5. **Generate** final alignment report

## Expected Results

Based on ETL repo success and Supabase data quality:
- **High confidence** all 5 episodes will align correctly
- **Vector search** should work with proper embeddings
- **Topic mentions** should match between systems
- **Chunk structure** should be consistent and searchable
