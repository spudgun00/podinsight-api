# Live Data Fix - Sprint 5 Completion

## Issue Resolution Summary
Successfully fixed the live data mode API failures that were preventing the dashboard from loading real data.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing python-dotenv Package
- `python-dotenv` was not in requirements.txt
- The `lib/env_loader.py` file imported it, causing import failures in Vercel
- **Fixed:** Added `python-dotenv==1.0.0` to requirements.txt (commit 5dead5c)

### 2. Environment File Loading in Production
- `env_loader.py` was trying to load a `.env` file that doesn't exist in Vercel
- This caused `FileNotFoundError: .env file not found at /var/task/.env`
- **Fixed:** Modified env_loader.py to detect Vercel environment and skip .env loading (commit f91e217)

## Technical Details

### Environment Detection Logic
```python
# In Vercel/production, env vars are already loaded
if os.getenv("VERCEL") or os.getenv("VERCEL_ENV"):
    # Running in Vercel, no need to load .env file
    return True
```

### Error Logs Resolved
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'
FileNotFoundError: .env file not found at /var/task/.env
```

## Verified Working Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/health` - Returns environment variable status
- ✅ `/api/intelligence/dashboard` - Returns episode intelligence data
- ✅ `/api/signals?limit=10` - Returns topic correlation signals
- ✅ `/api/topic-velocity` - Returns topic trending data
- ✅ All other API endpoints

## Environment Variables Confirmed
All required environment variables are properly configured in Vercel:
- MONGODB_URI (with database name included: `/podinsight`)
- MODAL_EMBEDDING_URL (trailing slash removed)
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_KEY
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
- ANSWER_SYNTHESIS_ENABLED

## Lessons Learned

1. **Vercel doesn't use .env files** - Environment variables must be configured through Vercel dashboard
2. **Missing dependencies cause cryptic errors** - Always ensure requirements.txt is complete
3. **Git disconnection can disrupt deployments** - The temporary GitHub disconnect may have contributed to deployment issues
4. **Environment-specific code needs guards** - Always check if code should run differently in production vs development

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Remove hardcoded MongoDB password check** in env_loader.py (lines 37-46) - it's checking for an old incorrect password
2. **Add monitoring** for API endpoints to catch failures early
3. **Document all required environment variables** in a setup guide
4. **Consider using environment variable validation** on startup

## Sprint 5 Status
- **Mock Data Integration**: ✅ Complete
- **Live Data Mode**: ✅ Fixed and working
- **Dashboard Toggle**: ✅ Fully functional

All Sprint 5 objectives have been achieved. The dashboard now successfully switches between demo mode (mock data) and live mode (real API data).
