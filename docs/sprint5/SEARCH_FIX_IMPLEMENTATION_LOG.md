# Search Fix Implementation Log

## Sprint 5 - Phase 1: Get Search Working

**Start Date**: 2025-01-12
**Objective**: Fix search hanging issue by addressing async/sync mismatch in Modal embedding service

### Context
- **Problem**: Search requests hang indefinitely due to ThreadPoolExecutor blocking the event loop
- **Root Cause**: `embed_query()` in embedding_utils.py is synchronous but called in async context
- **Impact**: VC users cannot search for investment insights, breaking core value proposition

### Implementation Plan

#### Fix 1: Async Modal Embedding (Priority: CRITICAL)
- [ ] Impact analysis - find all callers of `embed_query()`
- [ ] Make `embed_query()` in embedding_utils.py async
- [ ] Update `generate_embedding_768d_local()` to await embed_query
- [ ] Remove ThreadPoolExecutor hack from `encode_query()`
- [ ] Test complete embedding flow

#### Fix 2: 15-Second Modal Timeout
- [ ] Update timeout in embeddings_768d_modal.py from 25s to 15s
- [ ] Add retry logic for cold starts
- [ ] Implement proper timeout error messages

#### Fix 3: MongoDB Query Alignment
- [ ] Update all MongoDB lookups to use `episode_id` field
- [ ] Remove references to legacy `guid` field in joins
- [ ] Verify joins work correctly with aligned fields

### Questions Before Implementation

1. **Scope of embed_query() usage**:
   - Are there ETL scripts or batch processes using this function?
   - Is it called from any non-async contexts?

2. **Testing approach**:
   - Do we have a staging environment?
   - How should we test without affecting production?

3. **Rollback plan**:
   - Should we create a feature flag?
   - How quickly can we revert if issues arise?

### Progress Log

#### 2025-01-12 - Initial Analysis
- Created implementation plan
- Identified need for impact analysis before code changes
- Raised questions about scope and testing

#### 2025-01-12 - Day 1 Fix Implementation Complete
**Time: 3:30 PM - 4:00 PM (30 minutes)**

**All fixes successfully implemented:**

**Fix 1: Async Modal Embedding ✅**
- Modified `embed_query()` in `lib/embedding_utils.py` to be async
- Updated `generate_embedding_768d_local()` in `api/search_lightweight_768d.py` to await the call
- Changed `embed_query()` to directly call `_encode_query_async_with_retry()`
- Removed ThreadPoolExecutor blocking pattern entirely

**Fix 2: Modal Timeout Reduction ✅**
- Reduced timeout from 25s to 15s in `lib/embeddings_768d_modal.py`
- Added `_encode_query_async_with_retry()` method with 1 retry and 0.5s delay
- Better error messages on timeout

**Fix 3: MongoDB Field Alignment ✅**
- Updated 3 MongoDB lookups in `api/improved_hybrid_search.py`
- Changed foreignField from "guid" to "episode_id" for consistent field naming

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Embedding generation: 13.44s (within 15s timeout)
- ✅ Full search completed: 12.89s (no hanging!)
- ✅ Found results with proper scoring
- ✅ Answer synthesis working

**Key Metrics:**
- Response time: ~13s (down from infinite hang)
- Success rate: 100% in testing
- Modal warm instance: 0.37s (vs 13.36s cold start)

**Issues Identified During Testing:**
- MongoDB showed "ReplicaSetNoPrimary" warnings but recovered
- Context expansion is disabled (N+1 query issue to fix in Phase 2)

### Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel and monitor logs
2. Begin Phase 2: Make it Reliable (handle MongoDB replica issues)
3. Phase 3: Make it Fast (batch context expansion, caching)
