# Prewarm Endpoint Issue Report

## Issue Summary
The frontend prewarming implementation is receiving 404 errors when attempting to call the backend `/api/prewarm` endpoint, despite documentation indicating it should be available.

## Current Status

### Frontend Implementation ‚úÖ
- **Location**: `components/dashboard/ai-search-modal-enhanced.tsx`
- **Status**: Fully implemented with proper error handling
- **Behavior**: Calls `/api/prewarm` when search modal opens

### API Proxy Route ‚úÖ
- **Location**: `app/api/prewarm/route.ts`
- **Status**: Created to handle CORS and forward requests
- **Behavior**: Forwards requests to backend API

### Backend Investigation üîç
Found that the `/api/prewarm` endpoint IS implemented in the backend codebase:
- **File**: `podinsight-api/api/prewarm.py`
- **Route**: `POST /api/prewarm`
- **Registered**: Properly included in `api/index.py`

## Root Cause Analysis

The 404 error suggests one of these scenarios:

1. **Deployment Issue** (Most Likely): The backend code with the prewarm endpoint hasn't been deployed to production yet
2. **Vercel Configuration**: The endpoint might not be properly exposed in the production deployment
3. **URL Routing**: There might be an issue with how Vercel is routing the `/api/prewarm` requests

## Current Workaround

We've implemented graceful degradation:

```typescript
// Frontend now handles 404 gracefully
if (response.status === 404) {
  console.log('Prewarm skipped - backend endpoint not yet deployed')
  return true // Don't block search functionality
}
```

**Result**: Search still works perfectly, but users may experience the 18-second cold start on first search.

## Recommendations for API Team

### 1. Verify Deployment Status
Please check if the latest backend code (including `api/prewarm.py`) is deployed to production at `https://podinsight-api.vercel.app`

### 2. Test Backend Directly
Try calling the endpoint directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/prewarm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "warming",
  "message": "Modal pre-warming initiated"
}
```

### 3. Check Vercel Logs
Look for any deployment or routing errors in the Vercel dashboard for the API project.

### 4. Verify Route Registration
Ensure that in the deployed version:
- `api/index.py` includes: `from .prewarm import router as prewarm_router`
- The router is registered: `app.include_router(prewarm_router)`

## Impact

- **Without Prewarming**: Users experience 18-second delay on first search after Modal.com goes cold
- **With Prewarming**: Near-instant search results (2-3 seconds)
- **Cost Savings**: $80-90/month by avoiding 24/7 warm instances

## Next Steps

1. **API Team**: Deploy the prewarm endpoint to production
2. **Frontend**: Already handles both scenarios gracefully
3. **Testing**: Once deployed, the frontend will automatically start using it

## Questions?

The frontend implementation is complete and handles all edge cases. Once the backend endpoint is accessible in production, prewarming will work automatically without any frontend changes needed.

## Technical Details

### Frontend Call Flow
1. User clicks brain button (üß†)
2. Search modal opens
3. Frontend calls `/api/prewarm` (with 3-minute cooldown)
4. If successful: Modal.com warms up while user types
5. If 404: Log message but continue normally

### Backend Implementation (from code inspection)
- Fire-and-forget pattern
- Creates background task to warm Modal
- Uses `generate_embedding_768d_local` function
- Returns immediately to not block UI

The implementation is solid on both sides - we just need to ensure the backend is deployed!
