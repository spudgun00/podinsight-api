# Sprint 5: Cold Start Timeout & No-Results Display Fix

## Date: July 11, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cold Start Timeouts (504 Errors)
**Problem**: OpenAI client lacked timeout configuration, causing requests to exceed Vercel's 30s limit during cold starts.

**Solution**: Added timeout and retry configuration to OpenAI client initialization.

### 2. Frontend Shows Confidence on No-Results
**Problem**: Frontend calculates confidence from citation count (50% + 5% per citation). Even "no results" responses had citations, showing 55-70% confidence.

**Solution**: Return `null` for the answer field when no specific results are found.

## Implementation Details

### File: `/api/synthesis.py`

1. **OpenAI Client Timeout** (lines 38-44):
```python
# Add timeout and reduce retries for Vercel compatibility
_openai_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key=api_key,
    timeout=10.0,  # 10 second timeout (well below Vercel's 30s)
    max_retries=1  # Reduce from default 2 to 1
)
```

2. **Return None for No-Results** (both synthesize_answer and synthesize_answer_v2):
```python
# Check if this is a "no results" response
is_no_results = any(pattern in formatted_answer.lower() for pattern in [
    "no specific", "○ no", "no results found", "didn't find",
    "no insights found", "no data available"
])

if is_no_results:
    logger.info("[SYNTHESIS] No results detected, returning None for frontend")
    return None  # This will cause answer: null in API response
```

### File: `/api/search_lightweight_768d.py`

3. **Handle None from Synthesis** (lines 512-515):
```python
if synthesis_result:
    answer_object = AnswerObject(...)
else:
    # Synthesis returned None - this is a no-results scenario
    answer_object = None
    logger.info("Synthesis returned None - will return null answer to frontend")
```

## Test Results

Created test script `test_no_results_api.py` that confirms:
- **Before Fix**: No-results queries return answer object with citations → Frontend shows 60-70% confidence
- **After Fix**: No-results queries return `answer: null` → Frontend shows "No results found"

## API Response Structure

### No Results:
```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "answer": null,  // This triggers "No results found" in frontend
  "processing_time_ms": 150
}
```

### With Results:
```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "answer": {
    "text": "• Codeium - Over $1 million ARR...",
    "citations": [...],
    "synthesis_time_ms": 89
  },
  "processing_time_ms": 150
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Monitor for 504 errors (should be eliminated)
3. Verify frontend shows "No results found" properly
4. Consider implementing JSON mode optimization for more reliable parsing

## Future Enhancement: JSON Mode

The optional JSON mode optimization would:
- Use OpenAI's `response_format: {type: "json_object"}`
- Ensure structured, reliable output
- Eliminate regex parsing
- Make no-results detection more robust

This would involve creating a structured prompt that returns:
```json
{
  "has_answer": boolean,
  "answer": string | null,
  "citations": [1, 2, 3],
  "related_questions": ["q1", "q2", "q3"]
}
```

## Commits

- Fixed OpenAI client timeout configuration
- Updated synthesis functions to return None for no-results
- Updated search handler to properly handle None from synthesis
- Created test scripts to verify the fix

The fixes are ready for deployment to resolve both the cold start timeouts and the frontend confidence display issue.
