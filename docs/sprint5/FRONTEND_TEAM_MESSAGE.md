ðŸš¨ URGENT: Search Feature Down - CORS Fix Needed (15 min fix)

The core search functionality is broken due to CORS errors, blocking next week's VC demos.

**The Issue**: Frontend is calling backend directly instead of using a proxy
**The Fix**: Create `/app/api/search/route.ts` proxy (exactly like the existing prewarm proxy)

I've created a complete implementation guide with copy-paste code:
`/docs/sprint5/URGENT_FRONTEND_CORS_FIX_GUIDE.md`

**What needs to change**:
1. Create proxy endpoint: `/app/api/search/route.ts`
2. Update `ai-search-modal-enhanced.tsx` to use `/api/search` instead of direct backend URL
3. Test and deploy

This follows your existing pattern from `/app/api/prewarm/route.ts`. Should take ~15 minutes.

Can someone grab this? Happy to help if you have questions!

## For GitHub Issue:

**Title**: `[URGENT] Fix CORS error blocking search functionality`

**Body**:
```markdown
## Priority: CRITICAL ðŸš¨
Blocking demos scheduled for next week

## Problem
Search functionality is completely broken due to CORS errors when frontend calls backend directly.

## Error
```
Access to fetch at 'https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/search' from origin 'http://localhost:3002' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## Solution
Implement frontend proxy pattern (same as existing prewarm endpoint).

## Implementation
See detailed guide: `/docs/sprint5/URGENT_FRONTEND_CORS_FIX_GUIDE.md`

Quick summary:
1. Create `/app/api/search/route.ts` proxy endpoint
2. Update `ai-search-modal-enhanced.tsx` to use `/api/search` instead of `https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/search`

## Time Estimate
15 minutes (following existing pattern)

## Testing
- [ ] Search works locally without CORS errors
- [ ] Results display in search modal
- [ ] No console errors
```

**Subject**: URGENT: Search Feature Down - Quick CORS Fix Needed for Demos

**Body**:
```
Hi Frontend Team,

The search feature is currently broken due to CORS errors, and this is blocking our demos with VCs next week.

The fix is straightforward - we need to add a proxy endpoint for the search API, following the same pattern as the prewarm endpoint you already have.

I've prepared a complete implementation guide with all the code at:
/docs/sprint5/URGENT_FRONTEND_CORS_FIX_GUIDE.md

The changes needed:
1. Create a new proxy at /app/api/search/route.ts
2. Update one line in ai-search-modal-enhanced.tsx

This should take about 15 minutes since it follows your existing patterns.

Could someone from your team implement this today? The backend API is working perfectly - we just need the proxy to handle CORS.

Thanks!
```
