# URGENT FIX: Overly Strict No-Results Logic

## Date: July 11, 2025

## Critical Issue

The previous "fix" made the UX worse! We were returning null (showing "No results found") even when we had 9 relevant sources with 0.96+ relevance scores, just because the synthesis didn't contain specific dollar amounts.

## The Problem

**Before fix**: Users see "55% confidence" on truly empty results (bad)
**After "fix"**: Users see "No results found" on 9 relevant sources (terrible!)

Example:
- Query: "What are VCs saying about AI valuations?"
- We have 9 sources discussing AI (0.96+ relevance)
- But synthesis returns null because no specific $ amounts mentioned
- User sees "No results found" - terrible UX!

## The Solution

Only return null when we have NO relevant search results:

```python
# Only return null if we have NO relevant results at all
# Check if chunks have very low relevance scores
all_low_relevance = all(
    chunk.get('score', 1.0) < 0.5
    for chunk in deduplicated_chunks
    if 'score' in chunk
)

if len(deduplicated_chunks) == 0 or all_low_relevance:
    logger.info("[SYNTHESIS] No relevant results found (empty or all scores < 0.5)")
    return None
```

**REMOVED** the logic that checked synthesis content for patterns like "no specific", "○ no", etc.

## Key Changes

1. **synthesis.py**:
   - Only return None when chunks are empty OR all have score < 0.5
   - REMOVED content-based null returns
   - Let synthesis summarize what we DO have

2. **Better UX**:
   - Relevant content (score > 0.5) ALWAYS gets synthesized
   - Users see insights even without specific metrics
   - Only truly irrelevant queries show "No results found"

## Testing

Created `test_ux_fix.py` to verify:
- Queries with relevant content → Always get synthesis
- Only gibberish/irrelevant queries → Show "No results found"

## Result

Much better UX! Users see valuable insights from relevant sources, even when specific metrics aren't available. The synthesis can say "no specific valuations mentioned" while still providing context and related insights.
