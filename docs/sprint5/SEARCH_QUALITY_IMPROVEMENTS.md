# Search Quality Improvements - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Sprint**: 5 (Quality Phase)

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Database-Level Filtering
**File**: `api/improved_hybrid_search.py`
**Line**: 234
**Change**: Commented out `{"$match": {"score": {"$gte": 0.4}}}`
**Reason**: Filtering is now done in application layer for more control

### 2. Added Quality Constants
**File**: `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`
**Lines**: 47-48
```python
RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # Minimum score for results to be considered relevant
CANDIDATE_FETCH_LIMIT = 25  # Number of candidates to fetch from DB before filtering
```

### 3. Implemented Application-Side Filtering
**File**: `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`
**Lines**: 383-393
- Fetch 25 candidates from MongoDB
- Filter results where score >= 0.6
- Return dynamic count (1-10 results based on quality)
- Log score distribution for monitoring

### 4. Modified Context Expansion
**File**: `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`
**Line**: 409
- Changed from `enumerate(paginated_results[:3])` to `enumerate(paginated_results)`
- All high-quality results now get context expansion
- Maintains parallel processing with asyncio.gather()

### 5. Updated Synthesis to Use Quality Results
**File**: `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`
**Line**: 529
- Changed from `vector_results[:num_for_synthesis]` to `high_quality_results[:10]`
- Synthesis now only uses high-quality results

## Expected Behavior

### Before:
- Always returned 10 results regardless of quality
- Accepted results with 40% relevance
- Only top 3 results got context expansion
- Users saw many irrelevant results

### After:
- Returns 1-10 results based on quality (>= 60% relevance)
- All returned results are high quality
- All results get full context expansion
- Users see only relevant results

## Performance Impact

- **Fetching more candidates**: Negligible (25 vs 10 documents)
- **Context expansion**: ~0.05s per result
  - 3 results: ~0.15s (current)
  - 5 results: ~0.25s (typical)
  - 10 results: ~0.5s (worst case)
- **Total search time**: Still under 5s target

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No results meet threshold**: Returns empty result set
2. **All results meet threshold**: Returns up to requested limit
3. **Partial results**: Returns whatever meets quality bar

## Monitoring

The system now logs:
- Number of candidates fetched
- Number passing quality threshold
- Score distribution (min, max, count above threshold)
- Context expansion count

## Next Steps

1. Monitor user feedback on result quality
2. Consider adjusting threshold based on data (0.6 â†’ 0.65 or 0.7)
3. Add UI indicators for result confidence scores
4. Consider different thresholds for different query types
