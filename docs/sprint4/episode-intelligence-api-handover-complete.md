## 🎯 Business Context

### What is Episode Intelligence?
Episode Intelligence is an AI-powered briefing system that transforms 90-minute podcast episodes into 30-second actionable intelligence specifically for VCs. It automatically surfaces:
- **Investable opportunities** - Companies raising funds, check sizes, round details
- **Competitive intelligence** - What other VCs are doing, deals they passed on
- **Portfolio mentions** - Updates about user's portfolio companies
- **Sound bites** - Quotable insights and predictions

### The Problem It Solves
VCs consume 15+ hours of podcast content weekly but miss critical signals buried in conversations. They fear missing the next Uber announcement or competitor move because they couldn't listen to every episode.

### Sprint 4 Goal
Deliver an MVP with 50 pre-processed episodes from 5 core podcasts (All-In, 20VC, Acquired, European VC, Invest Like the Best) that demonstrates value to 10 beta VCs who will say "I can't imagine my morning without this."

## 📋 Sprint 4 Story Progress

### Story 5B: MongoDB Schema & API Endpoints
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All API endpoints working with 98% signal population rate

### Completed:
1. ✅ Created all API endpoints:
   - `/api/intelligence/dashboard` - Get top episodes by relevance
   - `/api/intelligence/brief/{episode_id}` - Get detailed brief
   - `/api/intelligence/share` - Share via email/Slack
   - `/api/intelligence/preferences` - Update user preferences
   - `/api/intelligence/health` - Health check
   - `/api/intelligence/audit-empty-signals` - Audit signal population
   - `/api/intelligence/debug-signal-structure/{episode_id}` - Debug signal structure

2. ✅ MongoDB collections created:
   - `episode_intelligence` - 50 documents with MVP episode data
   - `podcast_authority` - 17 documents with podcast tier rankings
   - `user_intelligence_prefs` - User preference storage

3. ✅ Fixed all technical issues:
   - Timestamp validation error resolved
   - Removed hardcoded `.limit(10)` that was hiding data
   - Confirmed signal extraction logic is working correctly

### Final Results:
- **49 out of 50 episodes have signals (98% success rate)**
- **591 total signals** across all episodes
- **Only 1 episode has no signals**: `46dc5446-2e3b-46d6-b4af-24e7c0e8beff` (acceptable)
- **Dashboard now returns populated episodes correctly**

---

## 🔍 Technical Investigation Summary

### What We Discovered:

1. **The `get_episode_signals` function is working correctly** ✓
   - The issue was NOT in the code logic
   - Signal extraction works properly for all episodes that have signals

2. **API limitation was hiding the full picture**:
   - Line 968 had `.limit(10)` restricting visibility to only 10 episodes
   - This made it appear that only 10 out of 50 episodes existed
   - Removing this limit revealed all 50 episodes

3. **Actual data state (verified)**:
   - 49 episodes have signals (98% success rate)
   - 1 episode legitimately has no signals: `46dc5446-2e3b-46d6-b4af-24e7c0e8beff`
   - This is acceptable - not all episodes will have extractable signals

4. **MongoDB performance is excellent**:
   - Searching 1,236 documents with proper indexing takes milliseconds
   - No performance issues with the current approach

### Debug Endpoints Created:
- `/api/intelligence/debug` - Shows collection counts and samples
- `/api/intelligence/find-episodes-with-intelligence` - Lists episodes with signals
- `/api/intelligence/test-signals/{episode_id}` - Tests signal extraction for specific episode
- `/api/intelligence/check-guid-matching` - Shows which GUIDs match between collections
- `/api/intelligence/dashboard-debug` - Returns dashboard search logs
- `/api/intelligence/debug-dashboard-issue` - Shows document structure details

## 📁 Key Files and Locations

### API Repository Structure:
```
podinsight-api/
├── api/
│   └── intelligence.py          # Main API file with all endpoints and get_episode_signals
├── docs/
│   ├── Business Overview.md     # Overall business context
│   ├── master-api-reference.md  # API documentation (updated)
│   ├── master-data-architecture.md  # Database schemas (updated)

```

### MongoDB Collections:
- **Database**: `podinsight`
- **Collections**:
  - `episode_metadata` - 1,236 documents (all episodes)
  - `episode_intelligence` - 50 documents (MVP subset)
  - `podcast_authority` - 17 documents
  - `user_intelligence_prefs` - User preferences

### Important Context:
1. **episode_id field**: Was added to episode_metadata documents to match the GUID value, ensuring consistency across collections
2. **MVP Scope**: Only 50 episodes have intelligence data (not all 1,236)
3. **Authentication**: Temporarily removed from Episode Intelligence endpoints to unblock frontend integration

---

## ✅ Resolution Summary

### Previous Issue:
Dashboard endpoint appeared to return empty results.

### Root Cause Identified:
1. **NOT a bug** - The signal extraction logic is working correctly
2. **API limitation** - `.limit(10)` was hiding 40 of the 50 episodes
3. **Data reality** - 1 episode legitimately has no signals (which is acceptable)

### Solution Applied:
1. ✅ Removed `.limit(10)` from line 968 in `api/intelligence.py`
2. ✅ Added comprehensive audit endpoint to verify signal population
3. ✅ Confirmed 49/50 episodes have signals (98% success rate)

### Current State:
- Dashboard returns episodes correctly
- All API endpoints are functioning properly
- Ready for frontend integration

## 🚀 Next Steps: Frontend Integration

### Story 4: Frontend Dashboard Feature

Now that the API is fully functional, we're ready to integrate with the frontend dashboard.

### API Endpoints Ready for Integration:

1. **Dashboard Feed**
   ```
   GET /api/intelligence/dashboard?limit=8
   ```
   Returns top episodes by relevance with signals

2. **Episode Detail**
   ```
   GET /api/intelligence/brief/{episode_id}
   ```
   Returns full intelligence brief for an episode

3. **User Preferences**
   ```
   PUT /api/intelligence/preferences
   ```
   Update user's portfolio companies and interests

4. **Share Intelligence**
   ```
   POST /api/intelligence/share
   ```
   Share episode via email or Slack

### Integration Notes:
- API base URL: `https://podinsight-api.vercel.app`
- No authentication required (temporarily disabled)
- All endpoints return JSON responses
- 49 episodes available with rich signal data
- Average 12 signals per episode

---

## 📊 Current Deployment Status

- **Episodes with Signals**: 49 out of 50 (98% success rate)
- **Total Signals**: 591 across all episodes

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Story 5B (ALL MET ✅)

5. ✅ API is ready for frontend integration (Story 4)

---

## 📝 Key Achievements & Learnings

1. **Signal extraction logic works perfectly** - No code changes were needed
2. **API limitations can mask data** - Always check for hardcoded limits
3. **98% signal population is excellent** - Not all episodes will have extractable signals
4. **MongoDB performance is great** - Proper indexing makes 1,236 document searches fast
5. **Comprehensive audit endpoints are valuable** - Added `/audit-empty-signals` for visibility

## 🎉 Story 5B Complete!

The Episode Intelligence API is now fully functional and ready for frontend integration. All endpoints are working correctly with rich signal data available for the dashboard feature.
