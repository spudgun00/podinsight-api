# Sprint 4 - Story 4: API Integration for Episode Intelligence

## Session Log - January 8, 2025

### Session Overview
**Goal**: Implement Story 4 - API Integration for Dashboard Episode Intelligence Components
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Status**: In Progress - Awaiting Vercel Deployment

### Key Discoveries

1. **Story Confusion Resolved**:
   - Story 4 and Story 7 were the same task
   - Previous work was done under Story 7 but in wrong repository
   - All previous code was deleted per user request
   - Starting fresh with correct approach

2. **Missing API Endpoints**:
   - The 4 Episode Intelligence endpoints didn't exist in API
   - Dashboard requirements specified endpoints that weren't built
   - Decision: Create new endpoints (Option 1) vs adapt existing (Option 2)
   - User chose Option 1: Create purpose-built endpoints

### Implementation Completed

#### 1. Created 4 New API Endpoints
**File**: `api/episode_intelligence.py`

- **GET /api/intelligence/market-signals**
  - Finds trending topics using MongoDB aggregation
  - Calculates urgency based on mention count
  - Returns topics with velocity metrics
  
- **GET /api/intelligence/deals**
  - Searches for funding/investment keywords
  - Extracts dollar amounts from text
  - Assigns urgency based on time-sensitive language
  
- **GET /api/intelligence/portfolio**
  - Searches for portfolio company mentions
  - Simple sentiment analysis (positive/negative)
  - Urgency based on negative sentiment
  
- **GET /api/intelligence/executive-brief**
  - Aggregates insights from sentiment_results collection
  - Provides cross-podcast analysis
  - Always "normal" urgency for summaries

#### 2. Technical Implementation Details

**Caching Strategy**:
```python
CACHE_TTL = 300  # 5 minutes
cache = {}  # Simple in-memory cache
```

**MongoDB Aggregation Example**:
```python
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {"created_at": {"$gte": start_date, "$lte": end_date}}},
    {"$group": {"_id": "$words", "count": {"$sum": 1}}},
    {"$sort": {"count": -1}},
    {"$limit": limit}
]
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "items": [...],
    "totalCount": 10,
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-08T10:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "cacheKey": "market-signals-v1",
      "ttl": 300
    }
  }
}
```

### Deployment Process

1. **Git Commit**: 
   ```
   commit c1c314b
   feat: Add 4 Episode Intelligence endpoints for Story 4
   ```

2. **Pre-commit Hooks**:
   - Fixed trailing whitespace
   - Fixed file endings
   - Added pragma comments for false-positive secrets

3. **Push to GitHub**: Triggered Vercel deployment
4. **Deployment Status**: Building (takes ~6 minutes)

### Testing Approach

Created `test_episode_intelligence.py` to validate:
- Response structure matches requirements
- Pagination works correctly
- Urgency filtering functions
- Cache behavior

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Auth Middleware**: Discovered auth not implemented yet (all endpoints public)
2. **Pre-commit Issues**: Had to install pre-commit in venv
3. **Route Conflicts**: Existing intelligence.py file, created episode_intelligence.py
4. **Deployment Time**: Vercel takes 5-6 minutes to deploy

### Next Steps (For Dashboard Integration)

1. **Verify Deployment**: 
   - Wait for Vercel build to complete
   - Test all 4 endpoints with real data

2. **Dashboard Implementation**:
   - Add to `.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://podinsight-api.vercel.app`
   - Create API client (no auth needed)
   - Implement React Query hooks
   - Replace mock data in components
   - Add 60-second polling

3. **Asana Updates**:
   - Mark all 8 Story 4 subtasks as complete
   - Document completion in Asana

### Files Created/Modified

1. **New Files**:
   - `api/episode_intelligence.py` - All endpoint implementations
   - `test_episode_intelligence.py` - Test script
   - `docs/API_INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Updated requirements
   - `docs/story-4-handover.md` - Session handover document

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `api/index.py` - Added router registration
   - Various docs with linter fixes

### Technical Decisions

1. **Simple Caching**: Used in-memory dict instead of Redis (simpler for MVP)
2. **Urgency Logic**: Based on thresholds and keywords (can improve later)
3. **No Authentication**: Following current API pattern (public endpoints)
4. **MongoDB Aggregation**: Leveraged for efficient data processing

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always Check Deployment Time**: Vercel can take 5-6 minutes
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Important for code quality
3. **Route Organization**: Check for existing routes before creating new ones
4. **Documentation First**: Understanding requirements saved time

**Session Status**: Waiting for Vercel deployment to complete
**Next Action**: Test endpoints once deployed, then proceed with dashboard integration
