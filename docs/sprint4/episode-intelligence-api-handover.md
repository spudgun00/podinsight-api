# Episode Intelligence API - Session Handover

## Session Summary (2025-01-08)

### What We Accomplished

1. **Fixed Field Name Mismatch**
   - Discovered that `episode_intelligence.signals` uses `content` field, not `signal_text`
   - Updated `get_episode_signals()` function to handle both field names
   - Added improved logging and fallback logic

2. **Optimized Dashboard Search**
   - Removed artificial limit on episode search
   - Now searches all 1,236 episodes to find the 50 with intelligence data

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added new collections to master-data-architecture.md:
     - episode_intelligence (50 documents)
     - podcast_authority (31 documents)
     - user_intelligence_prefs

### Current Status

**DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS** - The fix has been pushed but Vercel deployment takes ~5 minutes.

Last commits:
- `9182ece`: Improve signal content extraction with better fallback logic
- `a440cc5`: Add new Episode Intelligence collections to documentation

### How to Verify Success

Once deployment completes, run:
```bash
# Test dashboard endpoint
curl -X GET "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/intelligence/dashboard?limit=3" -H "Accept: application/json" | jq

# Should return real episodes with signals like:
# - "We passed on Uber's seed round"
# - "I give them their first 25K check or 125K check"
```

### Known Working Episodes

These 10 episodes have confirmed intelligence data:
1. `02fc268c-61dc-4074-b7ec-882615bc6d85` - "White House BTS, Google buys Wiz..."
2. `1216c2e7-42b8-42ca-92d7-bad784f80af2` - "RIP to RPA: How AI Makes Operations Work"
3. `46dc5446-2e3b-46d6-b4af-24e7c0e8beff` - "Do You Really Know Your ICP?..."
4. `4eaaa060-0bea-11f0-95d9-e30d5d6e6297` - "949. News: Kraken buys NinjaTrader..."
5. `0effa03a-025a-4c45-ba57-6ee1b7f1b0b3` - "Fed Hesitates on Tariffs..."

### Debug Endpoints

- `/api/intelligence/debug` - Shows collection samples
- `/api/intelligence/find-episodes-with-intelligence` - Lists episodes with signals
- `/api/intelligence/test-signals/{episode_id}` - Tests signal extraction for specific episode

### Technical Details

The issue was in `api/intelligence.py` line 175:
```python
# OLD (not working):
content=signal_item.get("signal_text", "")

# NEW (working):
content = signal_item.get("content") or signal_item.get("signal_text") or ""
```

### Next Steps

1. **Verify deployment completed** (wait 5 minutes from push time)
2. **Test dashboard returns real data**
3. **Update Asana ticket** - Story 5B should be complete once API returns real signals
4. **Consider adding more episodes** to episode_intelligence collection (currently only 50 MVP episodes)

### Asana Context

Working on Episode Intelligence API Implementation - Story 5B from Sprint 4.

## For Next Session

If deployment is successful and API returns real data, Story 5B is complete. Next priorities:
- Story 4: Episode Intelligence Dashboard integration
- Expand intelligence data beyond 50 MVP episodes
- Add authentication back to API endpoints
