---

## December 28, 2024

### Morning Session (Start)
- **Time**: 10:00 AM
- **Phase**: 1A - On-demand Audio Clip Generation
- **Focus**: Initial setup and documentation

#### Completed
1. Created Sprint 3 documentation structure in `docs/sprint3/`
2. Reviewed essential context files:
   - Sprint 3 Command Bar Playbook
   - PodInsight Business Overview
   - Complete Architecture Encyclopedia
   - MongoDB Data Model

#### Key Findings
- MongoDB has 823,763 transcript chunks with timestamps
- Audio files stored in S3: `s3://pod-insights-raw/{feed_slug}/{guid}/audio/`
- Need to implement on-demand generation, not batch processing
- 30-second clips: 15s before and after chunk start_time

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Approach**: Lambda function for on-demand generation
- **Storage**: New S3 bucket `pod-insights-clips`
- **Format**: MP3 using ffmpeg copy codec (no re-encoding)
- **Caching**: Store generated clips to avoid regeneration

#### Next Steps
1. Create Lambda function for audio clip generation
2. Set up S3 bucket with appropriate permissions
3. Implement API endpoint `/api/generate-audio-clip`
4. Add MongoDB tracking for generated clips

### Technical Notes
- Lambda timeout: 30 seconds (as per playbook)
- Memory allocation: 1GB (for faster processing)
- FFmpeg command: `ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ss [start_time] -t 30 -c copy output.mp3`

### Lambda Implementation Completed
- **Time**: 11:00 AM
- **Files Created**:
  1. `lambda_functions/audio_clip_generator/handler.py` - Main Lambda handler
  2. `lambda_functions/audio_clip_generator/requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## December 28, 2024 - Evening Session

### Phase 1B Testing and Debugging
- **Time**: 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM
- **Focus**: Debugging synthesis feature on Vercel

#### Issues Discovered and Fixed
1. **OpenAI Client Initialization** (FIXED)
   - Issue: `AsyncOpenAI(api_key=None)` at module level caused Vercel timeouts
   - Fix: Implemented lazy initialization pattern
   - Result: No more instant timeouts

2. **Model Access Error** (FIXED)
   - Issue: API key doesn't have access to `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`
   - Discovery: Only has access to gpt-4o models
   - Fix: Changed to `gpt-4o-mini` model
   - Available models: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-2024-05-13`, `gpt-4o-mini`

3. **Retry Logic Timeout** (MITIGATED)
   - Issue: 3 retry attempts could cause 3x delay
   - Fix: Reduced max_retries from 2 to 0
   - Added timing logs around OpenAI calls

#### Current Status
- ✅ Environment variables correctly set and read
- ✅ OpenAI synthesis works (1.64 seconds)
- ✅ Answer generated with proper citations
- ❌ Vercel still times out at 30 seconds

#### Key Findings from Logs
```
INFO: OpenAI API call completed in 1.64 seconds
INFO: Synthesis successful: 1 citations
INFO: [DEBUG] total_time_ms: 1845
ERROR: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT after 30s
```

**Mystery**: 28+ seconds unaccounted for between synthesis completion and timeout

#### Commits Made
1. `ef93ffa` - Create Phase 1B testing handover with debugging context
2. `2c7f39a` - Fix: Use lazy initialization for OpenAI client
3. `a226ba9` - Fix: Update OpenAI model to gpt-3.5-turbo
4. `f343084` - Fix: Switch to gpt-4o-mini model
5. `11857ab` - Fix: Add timing logs and disable retries

#### Next Steps
1. Add more granular timing logs after synthesis
2. Check response serialization time
3. Test with minimal response to isolate issue
4. Consider implementing streaming as suggested by Gemini
  3. `lambda_functions/deployment/template.yaml` - SAM deployment template
  4. `lambda_functions/deployment/deploy.sh` - Deployment script

#### Key Implementation Details
1. **API Format**: `GET /api/v1/audio_clips/{episode_id}?start_time_ms={start}&duration_ms=30000`
2. **S3 Key Format**: `audio_clips/{episode_id}/{start_ms}-{end_ms}.mp3`
3. **Pre-signed URLs**: 24-hour expiry for security and cost control
4. **Caching**: Checks S3 first (faster than MongoDB)
5. **Error Handling**: Proper status codes (400, 404, 500)
6. **Logging**: CloudWatch integration

#### Response Format
```json
{
    "clip_url": "https://s3-presigned-url...",
    "cache_hit": true/false,
    "generation_time_ms": 150
}
```

   - Utility functions working correctly
   - OpenAI mocking successful
   - Error handling verified
   - Retry logic tested

2. ❌ **Staging Integration Tests**: Synthesis not working on Vercel
   - API returns results but no answer field
   - Root cause: Missing environment variables on Vercel
   - Need to configure:
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `ANSWER_SYNTHESIS_ENABLED=true`

3. ✅ **Local Testing**: Everything works locally
   - Feature flag enabled

## December 28, 2024 - Phase 1B Testing Session (Evening)

### Synthesis Testing and Debugging
- **Time**: Evening session (continued)
- **Phase**: 1B - Testing and Debugging
- **Focus**: Getting synthesis working on Vercel

#### Major Issue Discovered
1. **Problem**: API returning 504 timeouts after adding synthesis
   - No logs appearing in Vercel
   - Function timing out after 30+ seconds
   - Complete failure, not just missing synthesis

2. **Root Cause**: Module-level OpenAI client initialization
   ```python
   # This was hanging during cold start:
   client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
   ```

3. **Failed Debug Attempt**:
   - Added `print()` statements at module level
   - This made the problem worse (no logs at all)
   - Had to revert changes

4. **Solution**: Lazy initialization pattern
   - Moved client creation to runtime
   - Only initialize when synthesis is called
   - Proper error handling for missing API key

#### Code Changes
- Implemented `get_openai_client()` function
- Client created on first use, not import
- Feature flag checked at runtime
- Added diagnostic logging inside handler

#### Collaboration with Zen Gemini
- Gemini correctly diagnosed the module initialization issue
- Provided the lazy initialization pattern
- Explained why serverless functions need this approach
- Helped avoid common pitfalls with diagnostics

#### Current Status
- **Commit**: 2c7f39a (lazy initialization fix)
- **Deployed**: To Vercel, awaiting verification
- **Expected**: No more timeouts, should see logs

#### Handover Created
- File: `HANDOVER_SPRINT3_PHASE1B_TESTING.md`
- Contains full context for next session
- Ready to verify if synthesis works

## December 28, 2024 - Phase 1B Implementation (New Session)

### Answer Synthesis Enhancement
- **Time**: Starting new session
- **Phase**: 1B - LLM Answer Synthesis
- **Focus**: Enhancing /api/search with OpenAI integration

#### Starting Tasks
1. Finding existing /api/search endpoint
2. Planning OpenAI integration for answer synthesis
3. Enhancing MongoDB pipeline for better recall (numCandidates: 100)
4. Implementing citation formatting with superscripts

#### Implementation Plan
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
- Temperature: 0 (deterministic)
- Max tokens: 80
- Context: ~1000 tokens (10 chunks)
- Response format: 2-sentence summary with citations¹²³

#### Implementation Progress
1. ✅ Created `api/synthesis.py` module with:
   - OpenAI integration using AsyncOpenAI client
   - Deduplication logic (max 2 chunks per episode)
   - Citation parsing with superscript conversion
   - Retry logic for resilience
   - Error handling with graceful fallback

2. ✅ Enhanced search handler (`api/search_lightweight_768d.py`):
   - Added synthesis imports and response models
   - Updated to always fetch 10 chunks for synthesis
   - Integrated synthesis call with error handling
   - Added processing time tracking
   - Included raw chunks in debug mode

3. ✅ MongoDB optimizations:
   - Updated numCandidates from `min(limit * 50, 2000)` to `100`
   - Better recall with controlled latency impact

4. ✅ Dependencies:
   - Added `openai==1.35.0` to requirements.txt

#### Key Design Decisions
1. **Separate synthesis module**: Clean separation of concerns, better testability
2. **Index-based citations**: Model cites with [1], [2], converted to superscripts in Python
3. **Graceful degradation**: If synthesis fails, return search results without answer
4. **Deduplication in synthesis**: Ensures diversity before sending to OpenAI

#### Testing Created
1. ✅ Unit tests (`tests/test_synthesis.py`):
   - Utility function tests (timestamps, deduplication, citation parsing)
   - Main synthesis function tests with mocked OpenAI
   - Error handling and retry logic tests
   - Citation metadata generation tests

2. ✅ Integration test script (`scripts/test_synthesis_integration.py`):
   - Tests common VC queries from the playbook
   - Measures end-to-end latency
   - Validates answer format and citations
   - Generates performance report

#### Next Steps
1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Test locally with `python scripts/test_synthesis_integration.py`
3. Deploy to staging/production
4. Monitor performance metrics
