## Phase 1A: Audio Clip Generation Tests

### Test Suite: Lambda Function Tests
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Status**: Completed

#### Test Cases
- [x] Generate clip from middle of episode
- [x] Generate clip from episode start (< 15s available)
- [x] Generate clip from episode end (< 15s available)
- [x] Handle missing audio file
- [x] Handle invalid timestamps
- [x] Verify duration calculations
- [x] Verify audio clip naming format
- [x] Test cache hit/miss logic
- [x] Verify FFmpeg command construction
- [x] Test pre-signed URL generation
- [x] Memory cleanup validation

### Test Suite: API Endpoint Tests
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Status**: Completed

#### Test Cases
- [x] Valid request returns audio URL
- [x] Invalid episode_id returns 404
- [x] Invalid parameters return 400
- [x] Duplicate requests use cached clip
- [x] Response time < 500ms (cache hit)
- [x] Response time < 4s (cache miss)
- [x] Concurrent request handling (5 parallel)
- [x] Pre-signed URL download verification
- [x] CORS headers validation

### Test Suite: Edge Cases & Security
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Status**: Completed

#### Test Cases
- [x] Zero-length clip handling
- [x] Tiny clips (10ms duration)
- [x] Negative timestamps validation
- [x] Clips exceeding source duration
- [x] Corrupted source file handling
- [x] Zero-byte source handling
- [x] Pre-signed URL permissions
- [x] Sensitive data not logged
- [x] /tmp directory limits

- [x] Environment variable validation

### Test Suite: Enhanced Tests
**Date**: December 28, 2024
**Status**: Completed

#### Enhanced Test Features
- [x] Parametrized tests for multiple scenarios
- [x] Clear expected vs actual comparisons
- [x] Business logic validation in each test
- [x] Realistic test data (speech, music, silence, corrupted)
- [x] Comprehensive error message validation
- [x] Performance assertions with thresholds
