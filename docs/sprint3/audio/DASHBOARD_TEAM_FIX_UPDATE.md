# Audio API Fix Update - Dashboard Team

**Date**: June 30, 2025
**Time**: 5:58 PM BST
**Status**: ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED

## Issue Found & Fixed

The FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED error was caused by a **route ordering bug** in the API code:

1. The health endpoint was defined AFTER the dynamic `/{episode_id}` route
2. This caused `/health` to be captured as an episode ID
3. ALL requests were failing because of this routing issue

## What Was Fixed

```python
# BEFORE (broken):
@router.get("/{episode_id}")  # This captured ALL paths including /health
...
@router.get("/health")  # Never reached!

# AFTER (fixed):
@router.get("/health")  # Now properly accessible
...
@router.get("/{episode_id}")  # Only captures actual episode IDs
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Simplified GUID handling**: The API now treats GUIDs as the primary identifier
2. **Better error messages**: Clear indication when ID format is invalid
3. **Cleaner code**: Removed unnecessary complexity

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Fix pushed to GitHub
- ‚è≥ Vercel deployment in progress (~6 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Lambda is working correctly
- ‚úÖ MongoDB lookups verified

## Test After Deployment

Once Vercel finishes deploying (check in ~6 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Test health endpoint
curl https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/health

# 2. Test with your GUID
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/673b06c4-cf90-11ef-b9e1-0b761165641d?start_time_ms=556789"

# 3. Test with known working episode
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/685ba776e4f9ec2f0756267a?start_time_ms=30000"
```

## Expected Results

1. Health endpoint should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "service": "audio_clips",
     "lambda_configured": true,
     "mongodb_configured": true
   }
   ```

2. Audio requests should return:
   ```json
   {
     "clip_url": "https://...",
     "cache_hit": true/false,
     "episode_id": "...",
     "start_time_ms": ...,
     "duration_ms": 30000,
     "generation_time_ms": ...
   }
   ```

## Key Understanding

- **GUIDs are the canonical identifier** (link MongoDB to S3)
- **ObjectIds are MongoDB internals only** (no S3 relationship)
- **Search API correctly returns GUIDs** (what you need)

---

**The route ordering bug was preventing ANY request from working. This is now fixed.**

Please test again once Vercel deployment completes (~6 minutes from now).

## UPDATE: Module Import Issue Fixed (6:45 PM BST)

### The Real Root Cause

After the route ordering fix, we discovered the API was still failing with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lib'
```

### Investigation & Discovery

After multiple attempts to fix Python import paths, we discovered:
- The `lib/` directory was in `.gitignore` (line 16)
- Git wasn't tracking these files
- **Vercel only deploys files in git**
- All our import fixes were pointless - the files weren't there!

### The Fix

1. Removed `lib/` from `.gitignore`
2. Added lib files to git: `git add lib/`
3. Removed all complex path manipulation code
4. Simple import now works: `from lib.embedding_utils import embed_query`

### What the lib directory contains

Essential AI utilities for the search API:
- **embedding_utils.py** - Converts text to 768D vectors for semantic search
- **embeddings_768d_modal.py** - Interfaces with Modal.com for AI embeddings
- **sentiment_analysis.py** - Analyzes sentiment of podcast content

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ Root cause found and fixed
- ‚úÖ lib directory now in git (commit: b887687)
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment complete (7:35 PM BST)
- ‚úÖ All complex workarounds removed

---

## FINAL UPDATE: API FULLY OPERATIONAL! üéâ

### Test Results (7:41 PM BST)

All endpoints are now working perfectly:

```bash
# Health check - WORKING ‚úÖ
curl https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/health
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "audio_clips",
  "lambda_configured": true,
  "mongodb_configured": true
}

# GUID format - WORKING ‚úÖ
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/673b06c4-cf90-11ef-b9e1-0b761165641d?start_time_ms=556789"
# Returns audio URL successfully

# ObjectId format - WORKING ‚úÖ
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/685ba776e4f9ec2f0756267a?start_time_ms=30000"
# Returns audio URL successfully

# Error handling - WORKING ‚úÖ
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/invalid-id?start_time_ms=30000"
# Returns: {"detail": "Invalid episode ID format - must be GUID"}
```

### Summary

The API is now fully operational. The issues were:
1. Route ordering (health endpoint after dynamic route)
2. lib directory was gitignored (essential AI utilities weren't deployed)

Both issues have been fixed and the API is ready for use!

---

## IMPORTANT: Supported ID Formats

The API only accepts two ID formats:
1. **GUID format**: `673b06c4-cf90-11ef-b9e1-0b761165641d` (8-4-4-4-12 pattern)
2. **ObjectId format**: `685ba776e4f9ec2f0756267a` (24 hex characters)

The failing request `substack:post:162914366` is not a valid format. The search API should return proper GUIDs that can be used with the audio API.

If you're seeing `substack:post:` format IDs, these need to be converted to GUIDs through your search API or episode metadata lookup.

### Key Learning

**Always check .gitignore first!** The simplest explanation is often correct. We spent 45 minutes on complex Python path manipulation when the files simply weren't being deployed.
