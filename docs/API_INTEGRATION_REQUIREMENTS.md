# API Integration Requirements - Episode Intelligence Dashboard

## Executive Summary of Confusion & Resolution

### What Was the Confusion?

1. **Story 4** (Dashboard Integration) was misunderstood as needing to create NEW API endpoints
2. **Story 5B** (API Endpoints) had ALREADY created the Episode Intelligence endpoints
3. We mistakenly created 4 new endpoints that duplicated/conflicted with Story 5B
4. The dashboard team expected 4 separate card-specific endpoints, but Story 5B created 1 consolidated endpoint

### What Was Done About It?

1. Created 4 new endpoints in `api/episode_intelligence.py`:
   - `/api/intelligence/market-signals`
   - `/api/intelligence/deals`
   - `/api/intelligence/portfolio`
   - `/api/intelligence/executive-brief`

2. These were DELETED once we discovered Story 5B endpoints already existed

### How It Was Corrected?

1. **DELETED** the duplicate `api/episode_intelligence.py` file containing:
   - `/api/intelligence/market-signals` ‚ùå REMOVED
   - `/api/intelligence/deals` ‚ùå REMOVED
   - `/api/intelligence/portfolio` ‚ùå REMOVED
   - `/api/intelligence/executive-brief` ‚ùå REMOVED

2. **REMOVED** router registration from `api/index.py`:
   ```python
   # DELETED these lines:
   from .episode_intelligence import router as episode_intelligence_router
   app.include_router(episode_intelligence_router)
   ```

3. **DELETED** all related test files:
   - `test_episode_intelligence.py` ‚ùå REMOVED
   - `tests/test_intelligence_api_comprehensive.py` ‚ùå REMOVED
   - `tests/test_intelligence_api_simple.py` ‚ùå REMOVED
   - `test_results_20250705_161224.json` ‚ùå REMOVED
   - `test-api-manual.html` ‚ùå REMOVED

4. **CLEANED UP** documentation:
   - Removed `docs/story-7-api-integration-setup.md` ‚ùå
   - Removed `docs/story-7-test-results.md` ‚ùå
   - Updated all docs to reflect correct understanding

5. **CONFIRMED** Story 5B endpoints are the official implementation
6. **CLARIFIED** that Story 4 is frontend-only integration

### Proof of Cleanup - Git Status

The following files were created in error and have been DELETED:
```bash
# Files that were removed:
D api/episode_intelligence.py
D test_episode_intelligence.py
D tests/test_intelligence_api_comprehensive.py
D tests/test_intelligence_api_simple.py
D test_results_20250705_161224.json
D test-api-manual.html
D docs/story-7-api-integration-setup.md
D docs/story-7-test-results.md

# Code changes reverted in api/index.py:
- Removed import of episode_intelligence router
- Removed app.include_router(episode_intelligence_router)
```

**Result**: The codebase is now clean with only Story 5B endpoints remaining

## ACTUAL API Endpoints (Story 5B - Already Live)

### 1. GET /api/intelligence/dashboard
Returns a consolidated response with ALL episode intelligence data.

**Actual Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "episodes": [
    {
      "episode_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      "title": "The Future of AI Agents",
      "podcast_name": "Tech Insights Podcast",
      "published_at": "2024-01-08T10:00:00Z",
      "duration_seconds": 3600,
      "relevance_score": 0.85,
      "signals": [
        {
          "type": "investable",
          "content": "Discussion about Series A fundraising trends in AI startups",
          "confidence": 0.85,

      ],
      "summary": "Episode summary not available",
      "key_insights": [
        "AI agents are becoming more sophisticated",
        "Enterprise adoption is accelerating",
        "New funding models emerging"
      ],
      "audio_url": null
    }
    // ... more episodes
  ],
  "total_episodes": 8,
  "generated_at": "2024-01-08T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### 2. GET /api/intelligence/brief/{episode_id}
Returns detailed information for a specific episode (modal view).

### 3. POST /api/intelligence/share
Handles sharing episodes via email/Slack.

### 4. PUT /api/intelligence/preferences
Updates user preferences for relevance scoring.

## Answers to Dashboard Team Questions

### Q1: Can you show me the actual response from /api/intelligence/dashboard?

**Answer**: See above. The endpoint returns ALL episodes with embedded signals. Each episode has a `signals` array with different types:
- `"investable"` ‚Üí Maps to Deal Intelligence card
- `"competitive"` ‚Üí Maps to Market Signals card  
- `"portfolio"` ‚Üí Maps to Portfolio Pulse card
- `"sound_bite"` ‚Üí Maps to Executive Brief card

### Q2: Are we committed to the Story 5B API structure, or can we request changes?

**Answer**: Story 5B is marked as COMPLETED in Asana, and the endpoints are already deployed. However, you have two options:

**Option A: Adapt Dashboard to Current Structure** (Recommended for MVP)
- Transform the consolidated response client-side
- Group episodes by signal type for each card
- Faster to implement, no API changes needed

**Option B: Request New Card-Specific Endpoints**
- Would require new Story to create 4 separate endpoints
- Better performance and caching capabilities
- Would take additional development time

### Q3: How is the dashboard data categorized in the API response?

**Answer**: The data is NOT pre-categorized by card type. Instead:
- Returns a list of episodes ranked by relevance score
- Each episode contains multiple signals of different types
- Client-side transformation needed to group by signal type

**Example Transformation**:
```typescript
// Transform API response to card-specific data
const transformDashboardData = (apiResponse) => {
  const marketSignals = [];
  const deals = [];
  const portfolioUpdates = [];
  const executiveBriefs = [];

  apiResponse.episodes.forEach(episode => {
    episode.signals.forEach(signal => {
      const item = {
        id: `${episode.episode_id}-${signal.type}`,
        episodeTitle: episode.title,
        podcastName: episode.podcast_name,
        content: signal.content,
        confidence: signal.confidence,
        publishedAt: episode.published_at,
      };

      switch(signal.type) {
        case 'competitive':
          marketSignals.push(item);
          break;
        case 'investable':
          deals.push(item);
          break;
        case 'portfolio':
          portfolioUpdates.push(item);
          break;
        case 'sound_bite':
          executiveBriefs.push(item);
          break;
      }
    });
  });

  return { marketSignals, deals, portfolioUpdates, executiveBriefs };
};
```

## Recommendation

### For MVP: Use Option A (Adapt to Current Structure)
1. **Faster Implementation**: No API changes needed
2. **Already Working**: Endpoints are live and tested
3. **Single Request**: One API call gets all dashboard data
4. **Transform Client-Side**: Use the transformation logic above

### For Future: Consider Option B (Separate Endpoints)
1. **Better Performance**: Load cards independently
2. **Granular Caching**: Different TTL per card type
3. **Error Isolation**: One failure doesn't break everything
4. **Direct Mapping**: No client-side transformation needed

## Implementation Steps for Option A

1. **Create Single Hook**:
```typescript
export const useIntelligenceDashboard = () => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['intelligence', 'dashboard'],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await apiClient.get('/api/intelligence/dashboard');
      return transformDashboardData(response.data);
    },
    refetchInterval: 60000,
  });
};
```

2. **Update Dashboard Component**:
```typescript
const { data, isLoading, error } = useIntelligenceDashboard();

// Render each card with its filtered data
<MarketSignalsCard items={data?.marketSignals || []} />
<DealIntelligenceCard items={data?.deals || []} />
<PortfolioPulseCard items={data?.portfolioUpdates || []} />
<ExecutiveBriefCard items={data?.executiveBriefs || []} />
```

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Story 5B endpoints are LIVE at https://podinsight-api.vercel.app
- ‚ùå **AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED** - Returns 403 "Not authenticated"
- ‚ùì Cannot test actual response without auth token
- ‚è≥ Dashboard needs client-side transformation
- ‚ùå No card-specific endpoints (would need new story)

## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKER

The Story 5B endpoints require authentication, but:
1. Authentication implementation is marked as "future work" 
2. No auth tokens are available for testing
3. Cannot verify actual response structure without auth

**This blocks Story 4 dashboard integration until auth is resolved.**

## Contact for API Changes

If Option B is preferred, create a new story for "Card-Specific Intelligence Endpoints" with requirements for:
- `/api/intelligence/market-signals`
- `/api/intelligence/deals`
- `/api/intelligence/portfolio`
- `/api/intelligence/executive-brief`
