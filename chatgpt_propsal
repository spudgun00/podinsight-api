**High-level take-away**

You’ve fixed the *big* blockers, but a few lingering details will bite you in production if you don’t tidy them up now:

---

### 1. The A10G price in your maths is still wrong

Modal’s public price sheet (June 2025) lists **\$0.000 306 per second ⇒ \$1.10 per hour**, not \$0.19.

* All “cost per request”, “GPU-hours / month”, and ROI lines that derive from the \$0.19 figure need to be recomputed.
* The qualitative story (“pennies per request, cheap until scale”) stays true—just don’t publish numbers that finance will later flag.

---

### 2. Your function reloads the model every call

In the “simple function-based” example you build `SentenceTransformer(...)` inside the handler. That destroys warm-call latency (<1 s) and nullifies the cost-per-request you quote.

* Either switch back to a class (`@app.cls`) with the model on `self`, **or** cache the model at module scope:

```python
MODEL = None

def get_model():
    global MODEL
    if MODEL is None:
        MODEL = SentenceTransformer("hkunlp/instructor-xl")
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            MODEL.to("cuda")
    return MODEL
```

### 3. Re-enable memory snapshots for a free 2-3× cold-start win

Modal patched the snapshot bug in March 2025. A quick test will show cold boots drop from \~10 s to \~4 s without touching your code. Leave `enable_memory_snapshot=True` unless you hit a reproducible failure now.

---

### 4. Concurrency guard-rail

An A10G is fine for \~10 simultaneous single-sentence encodes. Beyond that you’ll OOM CUDA. Add a tiny async queue or set `max_batch_size` in your handler, and raise `buffer_containers` when sustained QPS climbs.

---

### 5. Dependency pins

* Torch 2.7.1 wheels are built for CUDA 12.1/12.2; the `+cu126` tag you print won’t resolve. Pin `torch==2.7.1+cu121` (or stay on 2.6 while 12.6 wheels are in preview).
* `sentence-transformers==2.7.0` is fine, but 2.6.1 is the last release before the new tokenizer interface—lock whichever one you’ve actually tested.

---

### 6. Document how to redeploy without nuking the HF cache

A single sentence—*“`modal deploy … --detach` preserves the volume; never `modal app delete` unless you’re ready to re-download the 2 GB model.”*—will save the next engineer an hour.

---

**Bottom line**

You’ve turned a broken, CPU-only endpoint into a reliable GPU service with 10 s first-hit and sub-second warm latency—great work. Fix the pricing numbers, keep the model in memory between calls, flip snapshots back on, and the guide will be bullet-proof.
