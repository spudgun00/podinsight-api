# MongoDB Vector Search Status Check

## ‚úÖ What We've Done

1. **Created Index Successfully**
   - Name: `vector_index_768d`
   - Status: ACTIVE
   - Documents indexed: 823,763
   - Fields: embedding_768d (vector), feed_slug, episode_id, speaker, chunk_index (filters)

2. **Index Configuration**
   - 768 dimensions
   - Cosine similarity
   - Filter fields enabled

3. **Code Already Configured**
   - `api/mongodb_vector_search.py` already uses index name "vector_index_768d"
   - Correct field name "embedding_768d" is used

## ‚ùå Current Issue

The API is returning 500 errors when trying to search. This could be because:

1. **Vercel needs redeployment** - The function might be cached with old configuration
2. **Connection issue** - MongoDB connection might need to be re-established
3. **Environment variables** - Might need to verify MongoDB connection string

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Check function logs for `/api/search_lightweight_768d`
   - Look for specific error messages

2. **Redeploy the API**
   - The index was created after the last deployment
   - Vercel might need a fresh deployment to pick up the changes
   - Run: `vercel --prod` in the API directory

3. **Test Locally**
   - Set up local environment with MongoDB connection
   - Test if search works locally before deploying

## üìä Expected Behavior

Once working, searches should:
- Return results for queries like "AI", "startup", etc.
- Show similarity scores between 0-1
- Allow filtering by podcast show or speaker
- Response time under 1 second
