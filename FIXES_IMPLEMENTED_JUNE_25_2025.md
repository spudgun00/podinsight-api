# Fixes Implemented - June 25, 2025

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Identified the Original Embedding Instruction
Using reverse-engineering tests, we discovered that chunks were originally embedded with:
```
INSTRUCTION = "Represent the venture capital podcast discussion:"
```

Evidence:
- **0.9918 median similarity** (10/10 high matches) with this instruction
- 0.9499 median similarity with no instruction
- All other instructions scored lower

### 2. Restored the Correct Instruction
Updated `modal_web_endpoint_simple.py` line 41:
```python
# From:
INSTRUCTION = ""

# To:
INSTRUCTION = "Represent the venture capital podcast discussion:"
```

### 3. Fixed Nested Array Issue
The Instructor model returns embeddings as shape (1, 768) when using instruction format.
Fixed the array flattening in lines 161-175 to properly convert:
- From: `[[0.022, 0.020, ...]]` (nested array)
- To: `[0.022, 0.020, ...]` (flat array)

### 4. Files Changed
- `/scripts/modal_web_endpoint_simple.py` - Fixed instruction and array flattening
- `/scripts/test_embedding_recipes_modal.py` - Test script to find correct instruction
- `/scripts/reverse_engineer_embeddings.py` - Comprehensive reverse engineering script
- `/scripts/debug_modal_embedding.py` - Debug script for array format issue

## Expected Results Once Deployed

### Queries That Should Now Work
- ✅ "openai" (was returning 0 results)
- ✅ "venture capital" (was returning 0 results)
- ✅ "sequoia capital" (was returning 0 results)
- ✅ "artificial intelligence" (was already working, should continue)

### Test Commands
Once Modal is fully deployed (3 minutes), test with:

```bash
# Test Modal endpoint directly
curl -s --max-time 30 -X POST https://podinsighthq--podinsight-embeddings-simple-generate-embedding.modal.run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "test"}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Should return:
# - "embedding": [768 float values]
# - "dimension": 768

# Test search API
curl -s -X POST https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "openai", "limit": 5}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Should return multiple results
```

### Data Quality Tests
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 scripts/test_data_quality.py
```

Expected: 5/5 tests should pass (Known Queries test should now pass)

## Root Cause Summary

The issue was a combination of:
1. **Instruction Mismatch**: Chunks were embedded with the VC instruction, but queries were using no instruction
2. **Array Format Bug**: When using instructor format, embeddings were returned as (1, 768) arrays but not properly flattened

Both issues are now fixed. The system should return to full functionality.
