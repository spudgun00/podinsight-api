echo "🎯 Verified Performance Results:"
echo "   - Cold start: ~10 seconds (down from 150s)"
echo "   - Model load: ~9.5 seconds"
echo "   - Embedding generation: <1 second"
echo "   - GPU: NVIDIA A10 active"
echo "   - Dependencies: PyTorch 2.7.1, NumPy 1.26.4"
echo ""
echo "🔍 Next steps:"
echo "1. Function can be called via Modal CLI: modal run scripts/modal_web_endpoint_simple.py::generate_embedding --text 'your text'"
echo "2. For HTTP endpoints, check Modal dashboard for URLs"
echo "3. Update your application to use the new optimized endpoint"

echo "💰 Cost estimate:"
echo "   - 10 embedding requests/day: ~$3.70/month"
echo "   - 100 embedding requests/day: ~$37/month"
echo "   - Scales to zero when not in use"
echo ""
echo "🐛 Debug Info:"
echo "   - If you need HTTP endpoints, the class-based approach needs debugging"
echo "   - Function-based approach works perfectly for direct calls"
echo "   - Consider creating FastAPI wrapper for HTTP if needed"
