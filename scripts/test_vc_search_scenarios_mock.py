        "What's interesting about the current AI market is that the infrastructure layer is getting commoditized quickly. The real value is moving up the stack to vertical-specific applications. We invested in a healthcare AI company that's doing $5M ARR already.",
        "The moat question in AI is critical. Most founders think their data is their moat, but that's rarely true. The real moats are network effects, switching costs, and deep customer integration. OpenAI has a moat because of brand and ecosystem, not just technology.",
    ],
    "Series A/B Funding": [
        "For Series A in 2024, you need at least $1-2M ARR growing 3x year-over-year. The bar has gotten much higher than it was in 2021. VCs are looking for real traction, not just promises.",
        "The jump from Series A to B is brutal right now. You need to show not just growth but efficient growth. The rule of 40 is back - your growth rate plus profit margin should exceed 40%. We're seeing companies with great growth fail to raise because their burn is too high.",
        "Timing your fundraise is everything. Start when you have 18 months of runway, not 6. And always raise when you don't need to. The best deals I've seen were companies that had multiple term sheets because they were crushing it, not desperate.",
    ],
    "Product-Market Fit": [
        "Product-market fit isn't binary - it's a spectrum. The early signs are when customers start pulling your product rather than you pushing it. When your NPS goes above 50 and people are referring others without being asked.",
        "The biggest mistake founders make is optimizing for vanity metrics before finding PMF. Forget about MAU and focus on retention cohorts. If your 6-month retention is below 20%, you don't have product-market fit, period.",
        "Customer validation is about quality, not quantity. I'd rather have 10 customers who absolutely love the product and use it daily than 1000 who try it once. Deep engagement beats broad adoption in the early days.",
