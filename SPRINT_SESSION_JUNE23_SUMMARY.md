# Sprint Session Summary - June 23, 2025
*MongoDB Vector Search Implementation & Deployment Fixes*

## 🎯 Session Objective
Fix MongoDB vector search returning 0 results and resolve Vercel deployment issues

## 📊 Starting State
- Search returning 0 results for all queries
- MongoDB vector index created but not working
- Vercel deployment failing with "12 function limit" error
- Modal.com integration working but search pipeline broken

## 🔧 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **MongoDB Vector Search Configuration**
- **Issue**: min_score threshold of 0.7 too restrictive
- **Fix**: Lowered threshold and commented out score filter
- **Files**: `api/mongodb_vector_search.py`, `api/search_lightweight_768d.py`

### 2. **Vercel 12 Function Limit**
- **Issue**: Vercel counting ALL Python files as serverless functions
- **Root Cause**: 80+ test scripts in root directory + api_backup/
- **Fix**: 
  - Created scripts/ directory
  - Moved all test_*.py, check_*.py, verify_*.py files
  - Moved api_backup/ to scripts/
  - Updated .vercelignore
- **Result**: Reduced from ~90 files to 8 API files

### 3. **MongoDB URI Configuration Error**
- **Issue**: "Invalid URI scheme" error in Vercel logs
- **Root Cause**: Environment variable had `MONGODB_URI=` prefix in value
- **Fix**: Removed prefix, value now starts with `mongodb+srv://`

### 4. **Import Errors**
- **Issue**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Root Cause**: search_lightweight_768d.py importing deleted search_lightweight.py
- **Fix**: Removed pgvector fallback code and orphaned imports

## 📁 File Structure Changes
```
Before:
/podinsight-api/
  ├── test_*.py (50+ files)
  ├── check_*.py (20+ files)
  ├── verify_*.py (10+ files)
  ├── api_backup/ (3 files)
  └── api/ (14 files)

After:
/podinsight-api/
  ├── scripts/
  │   ├── all test files
  │   └── api_backup/
  └── api/ (8 files only)
```

## 🔍 Debugging Process
1. Used Vercel function logs to identify MongoDB connection issues
2. Created debug endpoints (later removed)
3. Systematic elimination of import errors
4. Verified Modal.com working via direct API tests

## ✅ Final Status
- **Modal.com**: ✅ Generating 768D embeddings successfully
- **MongoDB Atlas**: ✅ 823,763 documents indexed with embeddings
- **Vercel Deployment**: ✅ Successfully deployed under 12 function limit
- **MongoDB Connection**: ✅ URI fixed, ready for testing
- **Search Pipeline**: ⏳ Ready to test in next session

## 📝 Key Learnings
1. Vercel counts ALL Python files as functions, not just API endpoints
2. Environment variable values should NOT include the variable name
3. Always check function logs for exact error messages
4. Modal.com integration is solid - issues were all configuration

## 🚀 Next Session Priority
Test the search functionality:
```bash
curl -X POST https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "artificial intelligence", "limit": 3}'
```

Expected: Should return actual podcast excerpts with relevance scores!

## 📊 Session Metrics
- Duration: ~6 hours
- Commits: 12
- Files moved: 86
- Issues resolved: 4 major blockers
- Context remaining: 5%

## 📚 Key Architecture Documents

### Vector Search Architecture (VECTOR_SEARCH_COMPARISON.md)
This document explains the complete search architecture evolution:

**Old Architecture (Broken)**:
- Simple vector-only search with no filters
- Couldn't find specific terms or filter by show
- Returned 0 results due to missing index configuration

**New Architecture (Implemented)**:
- Vector search with filter fields (feed_slug, speaker, episode_id)
- Semantic search with 768D embeddings from Modal.com
- Can filter by podcast show or speaker
- Cost: <$1/month additional

**Key Technical Details**:
- Index name: `vector_index_768d`
- Collection: `transcript_chunks_768d`
- 823,763 documents fully indexed
- Uses Modal.com for generating embeddings
- MongoDB Atlas M20 cluster ($189/month)

**Future Roadmap**:
- Phase 2: Add keyword search capabilities
- Phase 3: Extract entities (companies, people, topics)
- Executive features: Investment tracking, sentiment analysis
