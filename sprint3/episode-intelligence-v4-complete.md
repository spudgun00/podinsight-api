# Episode Intelligence Feature Plan
## Version 4.0 - Sprint 4 Implementation Plan (Infrastructure-Aware Edition)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### What It Is
Episode Intelligence is an AI-powered briefing system that transforms 90-minute podcast episodes into 30-second actionable intelligence specifically for VCs. It automatically surfaces investment opportunities, competitive intelligence, and portfolio mentions from 1400+ episodes monthly.

### The Problem It Solves
VCs consume 15+ hours of podcast content weekly but miss critical signals buried in conversations. They fear missing the next Uber announcement or competitor move because they couldn't listen to every episode.

### The Outcome
Partners get push-button intelligence briefs showing only what matters: fundable opportunities, competitor moves, and portfolio impacts - saving 14+ hours weekly while never missing critical intelligence.

### What's Changed in Version 3
- **70% Infrastructure Already Built**: MongoDB, embeddings, audio streaming, and UI patterns exist
- **Leverages Existing Systems**: Reuses command bar's audio infrastructure and search patterns
- **Simplified Implementation**: Many technical challenges already solved in previous sprints
- **Cost-Optimized**: Uses existing AWS infrastructure ($17.52/month) and MongoDB cluster

## 5. Signal Architecture (Detailed)

### 5.1 Signal Categories & Keywords

```javascript
const SIGNAL_TAXONOMY = {
  investable: {
    tier1: {
      keywords: ["raising", "fund", "Fund II", "Fund III", "$[0-9]+M", "$[0-9]+B"],
      points: 20,
      multiplier: 1.5
    },
    tier2: {
      keywords: ["check size", "writing checks", "deploy", "dry powder"],
      points: 10,
      multiplier: 1.3
    }
  },
  competitive: {
    keywords: ["acquired", "exit", "IPO", "passed on", "lost the deal"],
    firmNames: ["Sequoia", "a16z", "Benchmark", "Accel", "Lightspeed"],
    points: 15
  },
  portfolio: {
    customList: "user.portfolio_companies",
    patterns: ["portfolio company", "our investment in"],
    points: 50
  },
  soundbites: {
    indicators: ["prediction", "thesis", "believe", "trend"],
    minLength: 50,
    maxLength: 200
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Signal Extraction Process (Leveraging Existing Infrastructure)

```
MongoDB Chunks → GPT-4o mini Analysis → Entity Disambiguation (Supabase) → 
Signal Categorization → Relevance Scoring → Storage
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use existing chunk_id references for audio generation
- Process in batches of 10 chunks
- Cache GPT responses for 24 hours
- Link signals to audio timestamps from chunks

---

## 6. Scoring Algorithm (Complete Implementation)

### 6.1 Base Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_episode_score(episode, user_prefs):
    # Component calculations using existing data
    keyword_score = calculate_keyword_intensity(episode.signals)
    recency_score = calculate_recency(episode.published_at)  # From Supabase
    authority_score = get_topic_velocity_authority(episode.podcast_name)  # Existing data
    personal_score = calculate_personalization(episode, user_prefs)
    
    # Weighted combination
    final_score = (
        keyword_score * 0.4 +
        recency_score * 0.3 +
        authority_score * 0.2 +
        personal_score * 0.1
    )
    
    return min(100, max(0, final_score))
```

### 6.2 Display Thresholds

- **Score 90-100**: Red hot 🔴 - Always display
- **Score 70-89**: High value 🟠 - Display if space
- **Score 50-69**: Market intel 🟢 - Show in expanded view
- **Score <50**: Hidden unless searching

### 6.3 Caching Strategy

**MVP (Sprint 4):**
- In-memory caching for top 8 episodes
- 60-second TTL for dashboard data
- No additional infrastructure needed

**Future (Post-MVP):**
- Redis implementation for scale
- Distributed caching across instances
- Pre-computed scores updated hourly

## 7. Technical Requirements

### 7.1 Data Pipeline (Infrastructure-Aware)
```
Existing MongoDB Chunks → Signal Extraction (GPT-4o mini) → 
Scoring Engine → MongoDB Storage → In-Memory Cache → 
API Layer → React Dashboard
```

### 7.2 Performance Requirements
- Episode processing: < 5 minutes (using chunks, not full transcripts)
- Brief generation: < 2 seconds
- Dashboard load: < 500ms
- Search results: < 1 second (future)
- Audio clip generation: < 3 seconds (on-demand)

### 7.3 Infrastructure Needs

- **New Required (Minimal)**: 
  - GPT-4o mini API access ($3/month for 5 podcasts)
  - In-memory caching (built into API)
  - Audio clip Lambda (adapt Sprint 3 pattern)

## 8. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: GPT-4o mini for Signal Extraction
- **Status**: Accepted (Updated from GPT-4)
- **Context**: Need to extract VC-specific signals cost-effectively
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Modal.com GPU endpoint already configured for AI calls
- **Decision**: Use GPT-4o mini with custom prompts via existing Modal.com patterns
- **Consequences**: 
  - ✅ 80%+ accuracy maintained
  - ✅ 90% cost reduction ($0.003/episode vs $0.03)
  - ✅ Faster processing
  - ✅ Reuses existing Modal.com infrastructure
  - ❌ Slightly less nuanced understanding

### ADR-002: MongoDB for Intelligence Storage
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need flexible storage for signal data
- **Existing Infrastructure**: 
  - MongoDB Atlas cluster with 823k transcript chunks
  - 768-dimensional vector indexes already configured
  - Connection pooling and patterns established
- **Decision**: Add `episode_intelligence` and `user_intelligence_prefs` collections to existing cluster
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Zero new infrastructure cost
  - ✅ Leverages existing connection patterns
  - ✅ Native vector support already tested
  - ✅ No new DevOps work needed

### ADR-003: In-Memory Caching for MVP
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: MVP needs fast response without Redis complexity
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Redis available but not required for MVP scale
- **Decision**: Use Node.js in-memory cache for MVP, migrate to existing Redis later
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Zero additional cost or setup
  - ✅ <100ms response time achieved
  - ✅ Can migrate to existing Redis infrastructure when needed
  - ❌ Limited to single instance for MVP
  - ❌ Cache lost on restart (acceptable for MVP)

### ADR-004: Audio Infrastructure Reuse
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need 30-second audio clips for signal validation
- **Existing Infrastructure**: 
  - Sprint 3 Lambda function for audio clip generation
  - S3 pre-signed URL generation working
  - Audio player React component built
  - ±15 second context extraction proven
- **Decision**: Reuse entire Sprint 3 audio infrastructure unchanged
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ Zero new development or infrastructure
  - ✅ Proven 30-second clip generation (<3s)
  - ✅ Pre-signed URL pattern tested at scale
  - ✅ UI components ready to integrate

### ADR-005: 5 Podcast MVP Scope
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Full 1,171 episodes too large for MVP validation
- **Existing Infrastructure**: All 1,171 episodes already processed and available
- **Decision**: Filter to only 5 core podcasts (~50-100 episodes) for MVP
- **Consequences**:
  - ✅ 90% reduction in processing time
  - ✅ $3/month vs $90/month GPT costs
  - ✅ Faster iteration and testing
  - ✅ Can expand to all episodes without infrastructure changes
  - ❌ Limited initial coverage (acceptable for validation)

## 13. The Bottom Line

Episode Intelligence transforms PodInsightHQ from a "search tool" to an "intelligence platform." By focusing on just 5 core podcasts and leveraging 70% existing infrastructure, we can validate the concept with minimal cost ($3/month) and maximum speed (Sprint 4 delivery).

**Sprint 4 Success = 10 beta VCs saying "I can't imagine my morning without this"**
