# BOOT Log Status Report

## Step 1: BOOT-TOP Print Added

### What I did:
Added at the very top of `api/topic_velocity.py`:
```python
import os, sys, time
print(
    f"[BOOT-TOP] sha={os.getenv('VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA','local')} "
    f"py={sys.version.split()[0]}  ts={int(time.time())}",
    flush=True)
```

### Deployment:
- Commit: 44d4177
- Pushed and deployed successfully
- Tested with: `curl -s https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/search -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"query":"ping","limit":1}'`
- Response received (search method: "text")

### Need to check logs for:
- `[BOOT-TOP]` - Should show SHA, Python version, and timestamp

## Next Steps (pending log check):

If `[BOOT-TOP]` appears:
- âœ… New bundle is running
- Proceed to Step 2: Add BOOT-SLW print

If `[BOOT-TOP]` doesn't appear:
- Traffic is hitting old deployment
- Check Vercel deployments tab
- May need to promote to production or redeploy

## Commands to check logs:
```bash
# Look for BOOT-TOP
vercel logs https://podinsight-api.vercel.app | grep "BOOT-TOP"
```
