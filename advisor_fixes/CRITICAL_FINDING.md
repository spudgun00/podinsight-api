# CRITICAL FINDING: Wrong Code is Running

## Evidence

1. **No debug logs appearing** despite adding:
   - `[BOOT-TOP]` at the very top of topic_velocity.py
   - `[VECTOR_HANDLER]` before vector search call
   - `[VECTOR_SEARCH_ENTER]` in vector_search function

2. **Supabase is still being called** for episode metadata:
   ```
   INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: GET https://ydbtuijwsvwwcxkgogtb.supabase.co/rest/v1/episodes
   ```
   
   But the code in `mongodb_vector_search.py` shows it should use MongoDB for metadata:
   ```python
   # Line 240-246: 
   logger.info(f"Looking up {len(episode_guids)} episode GUIDs in MongoDB episode_metadata")
   cursor = self.db.episode_metadata.find({"guid": {"$in": episode_guids}})
   ```

## Conclusion

The production deployment is running completely different code than what we're editing. This explains why:
- Vector search returns 0 results (might be using old index names or connections)
- Our debug logs never appear
- Supabase is still being called when it shouldn't be

## Possible Causes

1. **Wrong project/deployment** - We might be deploying to a different project than what's serving podinsight-api.vercel.app
2. **Build cache** - Vercel might be using cached build artifacts
3. **Different branch** - Production might be pinned to a different branch
4. **Import path issues** - The code might be importing from a different location

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. Verify we're deploying to the correct Vercel project
2. Check if production is pinned to a specific branch
3. Force a clean rebuild without cache
4. Verify the GitHub repo connection in Vercel dashboard
